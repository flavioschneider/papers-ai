      "text": "As recently pointed out by Haner (1999), in the past few years interest in the study of self-processes has burgeoned within many branches of psychology: developmental, clinical, social and personality. Also in educational psychology different concepts related to the Self have been the focus of much research and many theories (see the classic studies by Rotter, r\u00f9Teiner and Bandura). In their studies of school contexts, some authors have analyzed how s\u00f9dentS beliefs about their abilities and comperence change during their school years (Harter, 1981;Eccles et al., 1984i Harter et al., L992).\nIn particular, in the transition from primary to lower middle school pupils face changes in social relationships and environment, as well as higher learning requirements. For this reason, the impact of a normative school transition on early adolescents' self-system has recently become a focal topic in educational research (Seidman et al., L994, 1996).\nThe self-system is considered as a multidimensional constnrct, which consists of affective, cognitive, motivational and behavioural domains. The transition per se may prove critical for these different domains, as it modifies aspects related to self-esteem and motivation, as well as influencing scholastic achieztement.\nThe Self System as a Muhidimensional Constntct Different authors have defined beliefs about the self in several ways and used different scales to measure this construct (Anderman & Maher, 1994). Many of them have referred ro self-esteem as the affective aspects of the construct (e.g. Seidman et al.,1994), while others (McPhail & Stone, 1995) have suggested subsuming both affective and cognitive components under one \u00eeerm: self-concept. An analysis comparing three selfconcept and two self-esteem scales showed that they measure a virtually identical constmct (Crain & Bracken, 1994). From this point of view, a definition of self-concept involves both feelings and knowledge about one's own skills, abilities, appearance, and social acceptability (Bourcet, 1998).\nIn this paper, we refer alternately to self-concept and sellesteem, depending on the term used by the different authors. However, the construct we refer to subsumes evaluative and descriptive components of the self and has a multidimensional nature (Marsh, 1989;Bracken, 1992;Rosenberg et al., 1995;Measelle et al., 1998).\nFrom this point of view, self-concept is a hierarchical construct which can be divided into different academic and non-academic components (Shavelson er al.,19761' Marsh, 1989). Marsh and collegues (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985;Marsh, 1989) claimed that self-concept cannot be adequately understood if multidimensionality is ignored (see also Delugach et al., 1992). Many authors have made a distinction between global self-concept and specific self-concepts. The latter reflect people's evaluation of how well they perform in certain aspects of their lives. Most likely these evaluations vary significantly across contextual domains, as reflected by the well-known construct of 'working self-concept' (Marcus & Kunda,198\u00f3). Rosenberg et al. (1995) claimed that global and specific self-esteem are different in both nature and consequence. They are interrelated but not interchangeable. Global self-esteem is defined as the attitude toward an object (the Self) as a totality. On the other hand, specific self-esteem is an attitude toward a specific facet of Self. Global self-esteem is mostly affective in nanrre and tends \u00eeo be associated with overall psychological well-being. Specific self-esteem (i.e. academic self-esteem) appears more cognitive in nature and tends to be more relevant to behavioural outcomes (in this specific case, school performance). Furthermore, specific self-concept is more context dependent than global self-concept and is therefore less stable (Crain & Bracken, 1994;Harter, 1999). For these reasons) different specific aspects of sel\u00c8concept, rather than the global construct, are considered. Bracken et al. in their hierarchical model evaluate six domain-specific sel\u00c8concepts: academic, social, physical, competence, affect and family self-concepts (Bracken, 1992;Ctatn & Bracken, 1994). Academic self-concept concems the pupil's academic performance; social self-concept refers to interpersonal relationships; physical self-concept concerns both physical appearance and physical ability; competence self-concept is related to successful behaviours within the environment; finally, affect and family self-concepts refer respectively to emotional reactions and to the family situation.\nAs pointed out previously, variables connected to motivation and particularly to achieaement mot'iz;ation appear to play a key role in the study of the self-processes that drive and facilitate school learning (Dweck, 1986). Deci et al. (199L) and Corbi\u00e8re (1997) emphasised the importance of the presence/ absence of motivation (especially intrinsic motivation) in determining school performance. Motivation also may be considered and evaluated as a non-unitary construct. It differs in terms of the intemaVexternal dimension (Vallerand et al. 1992). Motivation is internal or intrinsic when students are intrinsically motivated to learn and engage in educational activities ('I go to school because I like learning new things'). Conversely, motivation is external or extrinsic when the learning process is just a way of obtaining other benefits, such as social success or other kinds of rewards ('I go to school to get good marks or to get a bener job in the future').\nThe correlations between educational affect and motivational orientation that emerged in the study by Harter et al. (1992) suggest that inuinsic and exuinsic motivation are separate dimensions, rather than the extremes of a continuum (Corbi\u00e8re, 1997). General positive affect towards school is associated with an intrinsic motivational orientation, but not with extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, specific anxiety about school performance is related to extrinsic, but not to intrinsic motivational orientation.",

      "text": "Numerous snrdies showed a decline in students' grade-point average after school \u00daansition. There can be two explanations for this change. The first takes into account the higher level of leaming required by the teachers (Simmons & Blyth, 1987;Seidman et al., 1994) . The second is that middle school students are more performance oriented than fifth grade pupils (Anderman & Midgley, 1997). When students are performance orientated, they work harder in order to demonstrare their skills. However, task-orientated students (such as elementary school students) work in order to improoe t}ret competencies. This is connected to a more positive attitude towards learning and to the use of effective learning s\u00faategies. As was pointed out earlier, many researchers (Anderman & Maehr, 1994;\\7igfield & Eccles, 1994) mantain ttrat self-esteem and self-concept decrease during early adolescence as a result of both individual development and changes in home and school environments (see Eccles & Midgley, 1989 for a review; Proctor & Choi, L994 for results pointing in the opposite direction).\nEven beliefs concerning specific abilities (i.e. academic performance and social abilities) become more negative immediately after the uansition (Eccles et aJ., 1984i Ffafter, 1981Harter er al., 1992;Vigfield & Eccles, L994).\nThe explanations that the authors gave for these results are two-fold. On the one hand, there are changes in the way students judge their own competence. Young children seem to over-estimate their competence, while early adolescents appear to be more realistic. On the other hand, factors associated with the new school environment may influence students' beliefs about their own competencies. Our hypothesis is that there are some other aspects of domain-specific sel\u00c8concept besides the academic self-concept which are sensitive to the changes brought about by transitions. In particular, the competence sellconcept which relates to behaviours oriented to environmental control is probably the most affected by a change of school (and environment). Furthermore, as competence self-concept concerns the behaviour in a number of situations and at different times (and can thus be considered the most pervasive domain-specific self-concept) it will probably influence the other domain-specific sel\u00c8concepts.\nMoreover, compared to primary school, the educational environment of middle school often fails to keep up students'motivation (Anderman & Maehr, 1994;Butler, 1999). In lower middle school there is greater emphasis on discipline and teacher contol, together with a less personal teacher/pupil relationship. In addition, students have fewer oppornrnities to make decisions, choose activities and manage their own learning process (Anderman & Maehr, 1994). Corbi\u00e8re (L997) considered the consequent lack of motivation (amotivation) as the best predictor of academic failure.\nIn addition to a general decline in motivation, a shift from a predominantly intrinsic to a more extrinsic motivational orientation was ascertained over a period of \u00f3 years, from third grade to ninth grade, particularly between sixth grade and seventh grade (Harter, 1981). This can be explained by the self-determination theory. This theory (Ryan & Grolnick, 1986;Deci et al., l99L) mantains that social-contextual factors influence intrinsic motivation and, consequently, academic performance. Central to this theory is the idea that only social contexts that support people's autonomy are able to promote inuinsic motivation. Thus, a more control-orientated educational environment has a significant negative effect on s\u00eeudents' motivation and self-determination. To sum up, a number of studies revealed ttrat following the transition from primary to low middle school, pupils immediately become more negative about school and about themselves, more anxious about their performance and less inuinsically motivated.\nNevertheless, a number of questions remain to be answered, One concerns what changes in self-concept and motivation remain after an initial period of adaptation in the new school environment. In addition, the connections between specific self-concepts (not only the academic one), different aspects of motivation and school grades in the transition seems to have been only panially explored. There is little agreement in the literature about the nature and the direction of the reciprocal influences between these variables. Low self-esteem has often been cited as a possible cause ofpoor school performance. Other studies draw different conclusions, ruling out a significant correlation between academic achievement and global sel\u00c8esteem in favour of a correlation limited to the academic sel\u00c8concept (Harter) 1983;Rosenbetg et al., 1995;Bandura el al., 1996;Corbi\u00e8re, 1997;Rosati & Vio, 1997).\nAs far as motivation is concerned, Harter et al. (1992) emphasised the impact of environmental changes on perceptions of competence, which in turn influences motivational orientation. The authors proposed a possible alternative interpretation: environmental changes, with their increasing focus on external evaluation, may have an initial impact on motivational orientation and increase extrinsic motivation; extrinsic motivation) however) may lead to more objective self-evaluation, which would undermine the perceived competence of the less competent sflrdents. They underlined that the relationship between perception of competence and motivation is reciprocal in nature. Flowever, the most likely causal scenario is one in which changes in perceived competence affect changes in motivation, which in turn further affect perceived competence.\nFinally, the environmental changes pointed out by a number of researchers are perhaps less pronounced in the present Italian school system. For example, the subject specialisation and variety of teachers that characterise middle schools (Seidman er a/., L994) l::ave been typical of Italian primary schools for almost 10 years. In this kind of school organisation the effects of the tansition found in other cultural contexts are perhaps to some extent reduced.\n\\7e carried out a longitudinal study in two stages: the first one at the end of primary school and the second in the second half of the first vear of lower middle school.\nThe aims of this snldv were three-fold:\n. to explore changes in specific aspects of self-concept, aspects of motivation and school achievement after the transition from the fifth grade of primary school to the first year of lower middle school; . to higNight the main links between single characteristics of self-concept, aspects of motivation and school achievement. and their evolution at the two school levels; o to identiff longitudinally which different components of self-concept and motivation have most effect on academic achievement.\nIn particular, the following hypottresis can be advanced:\nl. \\\u00f9fle hypothesise a decrease in final school grades. Also we expect a failing-off in self-concept, limited however to those aspects directly affected by the transition to a more controlled educational setting, namely the academic self-concept and the self-concept related to environmental control competence (competence sel\u00c8concept). In addition, we predict an increase in amotivation and extrinsic motivation along with a decline in self-determined, intrinsic motivation. 2.\n'We expect significant conelations between school grades and the following variables at both school levels: positive with academic sel\u00c8concept, competence self-concept and intrinsic motivation, negative with amotivation. Moreover, we hypothesise that school grades correlate significantly with extrinsic motivation in lower middle school. 3. \\\u00f97e hlpothesise a significant influence of competence sel\u00c8concept on other facets of the sel\u00c8system (i.e. academic self-concept, different aspects of motivation), which in turn directly influence academic performance. Furthermore, some possible changes in these causal relationships are expected after the transition, in the direction of a stronger effect of competence self-concept on determining both academic self-concept and motivation.",

This approach was chosen in order to avoid copying and to ensure that the children gave personal, original answers. The questionnaires were administered during school time. In order to get the children acquainted with the researchers, a brief int\u00eeoductory interview was held, during which the children were informed about the aims of the research.

      "text": "Each child was required to complete questionnaires that assess self-concept levels and learning motivation. Sel\u00c8concept was gauged using the Italian version of the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale (MSCS, Bracken 1992). This test is a 150-item self-report inventory, comprising six scales (25 items each), each of which represents a specific sel\u00c8concept domain.\nThe validity of the MSCS construct has been described and supported in the Examiner's manual and in numerous empirical studies (e.g. Crain & Bracken, 1994;Jackson & Bracken, 1998).\nIt is possible to use and evaluate the instrument's six different scales independendy. Bearing this fact in mind and considering the aims of our study, we decided to use only four of the six scales, namely those related to: o social sel\u00c8concept; . competence sellconcept; o academic self-concept; o physical self-concept.\nThe decision to omit the scales relating to emotion and family life was taken in the light of the sampling context and the specific objectives of the research. The study focused exclusively on factors that could be observed and modified within the school context, without taking account of the clinical aspects (such as the patterns of emotional reaction) that these last two scales are designed to gauge.\nTo investigate motivation in ttre school context, we chose the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) by Vallerand et al. (1992), adopting the Italian version produced by Tressoldi & Vio (1996). Composed of 28 items, this instrument provides separate scores for extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation and lack of motivation (termed as 'amotivation'), thus allowing independent evaluation of each.\nThe final school grades have been recalibrated, as they are expressed in different ways at different school levelsr. In primary school (T1), grades are expressed using letters: A: full competence, B: a good level of competence, C : a fair level of competence, D: only partial competence, E: the pupil has yet to achieve a satisfactory level of competence. By contrast, assessment in lower middle school (T2) is expressed in five levels of academic achievement: excellent, very good, good, pass and fail.\nDespite their apparent similarity, the two evaluation systems do not actually match up. At Tl not one E was given in any subject, effectively reducing the scale from five to four levels. Consequently) the lower middle school grades were reduced to a four-point scale in which the extremes (4 and l) remained the same while the intermediate grades were recalibrated as closely as possible to the grades expressed in letters. Hence, a pass was attributed 1.75 points, good 2.5 points and very good 3.25, while a fail was counted as I point and excellent as 4. This made it possible to compare the grades given in fifth year with those in the first year of lower middle school.",

      "text": "Means and standard deviations of the MSCS, AMS sub-scales and final grades at Tl and T2 are given in Table I.\nGtest was used to compare scores at T1 and T2. Comparison of the children's answers to the different scales brings to light areas of stability and variation in the transition from primary to lower middle school (see Table I).\nAccording to many authors (see, e.g. Simmons & Blyth, 1987;Seidman et al.,1994), grade-point averages show a significant decline after moving from one school to another. Moreover, academic self-concept scores decrease significantly in the transition from primary to lower middle school (Harter, 1981;Eccles et al., 1984;Hafier et al., 1992;\\7igfield & Eccles, 1994). The other domain-specific self-concepts remain stable during the transition: results for competence, social and physical self-concept do not change.\nContrary to our initial hypothesis, changes only occur in the academic self-concept and not in the competence self-concept. It may well be that children's competence self-concept declines temporarily following the impact with the new setring and rhen recovers completely in a few months) as indeed other authors have found for beliefs relating to abilities in specific activities flVigfield & Eccles, 1994).\nThe results concerning intrinsic motivation are partially consistent with the hypotheses. No variation was found in exuinsic motivation and amotivation. As expected, the level of intrinsic motivation in lower middle school decreases. Somewhat paradoxically, lower middle school places greater emphasis on discipline and conuol at a time when early adolescents have an increasing desire for autonomy and self-determination (Eccles & Midgley, 1989;\\7igfield & Eccles, 1994;Corbi\u00e8re, L997).\nIn order to evaluate connections between dimensions of self-concept, aspects of motivation and final school grades at Tl and T2, correlations were made using Pearson's coefficient (Table II).\nAs hypothesised, academic and competence self-concepts at Tl correlate significantly with the final school grades, according to Harter (1983), Rosenberg er a/. (1995) and Corbi\u00e8re (1997).It should be noted that these grades do not correlate with either intrinsic or exuinsic motivation, showing only a significant negative correlation with amotivation.\nIntrinsic motivation shows a significant positive correlation with two MSCS subscales) namely academic and social self-concepts. By contrast, no significant correlations emerge between the results of the MSCS scales and extrinsic motivation, suggesting a very selective relationship between pleasure in studying and a positive self-concept in some dimensions. Similarly, Deci et al. (1981) found a positive correlation between pupils' intrinsic motivation and sellesteem.\nThe T2 results panially confirm those from T1. School grades correlate significantly with competence and academic self-concept scales. In particular, correlation between academic self-concept and school grades increases significantly from Tl to T2 (2:1.66, P < 0.05, homogeneity of correlation coefficients tesr, Steel & Torrie, 1981). As to the dimension of physical and social self-concept, no direct relationships with school results emerge even in the first year of lower middle school.\nHence, contrary to our expectations school grades do not appear to correlate with the different motivational aspects at this age level either, but only with the absence of motivation. This negative correlation is stronger in T2 than inTI (2:2.20, P < 0.05). 1.00 1.00\nFor this age gtoup, intrinsic motivation correlates with all the MSCS sub-scales, particularly with competence and academic self-concepts.\nIt should be noted that, unlike at the preceding level (T1), exuinsic motivation shows positive correlations with all the different domain-specific self-concepts, probably in response to the greater significance attributed to evaluation feedback flVigfield & Eccles, 1994) . Finally, another difference with the fifth year is that amotivation presents highly significant negative correlations with the competence and academic self-concept scales.\nTo summarise: a differential correlation between school grades and domain-specific self-concept emerges at bo\u00eeh age levels, confirming the self-concept as a multidimensional constnrct.\nFurthermore, our results point to the existence of more substantial, and generalised links between domain-specific self-concepts and motivational aspects in the older children.\nIn addition, our results reveal a close connection between amotivation and low scholastic achievement that increases with age. Nevertheless, unlike the findings of other researchers (Deci et al., L99L;Vallerand et al.,1992;Corbi\u00e8re, 1997), they do not reveal any direct link between intrinsic learning motivation and school grades.\nIn order to further investigate the causal components related to the final school grades we performed a path analysis considering the variables that correlated significantly with final school grades both at Tl and T2: competence and academic self-concept, and amotivation. Ve also included intrinsic motivation in the model. This variable did not significantly correlate with the final grades, but with the MSCS subscales at both age levels. The high correlation with specific self-concepts could mask a potential ef\u00c8ct of inuinsic motivation on school grades. Furthermore, none of the other variables presented a similar pattern of correlation.\nThe analysis to obtain the model was conducted using J\u00f3reskog and S\u00f3rbom's (1996) LISREL 8 program. This model tested whether the model parameters were consistent across the two stages of the study.\nA covariance matrix with the l0 observed variables was used as a database for the sructural analysis. The specified model was tested with standardised coeffrcients obtained from the ML method of estimation.\nThe model provided a good fit to the data on most criteria (see Table III). The chi-square was oot significant (P:0.52), indicating that the discrepancies between the observed data and the model were statistically not significant. The standardised root mean square of the residuals (RIVIR) and the root mean square error of approximation (R.fvtSEA) were relatively small, indicating that the discrepancies between the acnral covariance matrice and that implied by the model were negligible (Browne & Cudeck, 1993). The goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the adjusted-goodness-o\u00c8 fit index (AGFI), the normed-fit-index (NFI) and the incremental-fit-index (IFI) were all relatively high, indicating that a very high portion of the information contained in the original covariance matrice was explained by the model.\nStandardised parameters estimated from the model are shown in Fig. 1.\nIn the hierarchical model proposed by Bracken (1992;Crain & Bracken, 1994), competence and academic self-concept are at the same level. However, behaviour orientated to environmental control are performed in many situations and at vinually any time. For this reason, we chose to indicate the competence sel\u00c8concept as the construct that influences the other variables of the model. As children succeed or fail in their attempts to function efficiently within their environment, they estimate the success of their actions and their own competence in the different fields.\nThe academic self-concept was positively affected by the competence self-concept, both at Tl and T2 (0.73 and 0.70, respecrively). On the other hand, morivarional variables were not significantly determined by the competence self-concept at Tl. According to Harter et al. (1992), intrinsic motivation was affected by the academic self-concept: children who feel positive or negative about their academic success were, respectively, more or less intrinsically motivared.\nThe transition from primary to middle school brings about a change in the relationship between competence self-concept and the motivational variables (intrinsic motivation and amotivation)i atT2, while high levels of competence reduce the absence of learning motivation ( -0.41), they also increase the level of intrinsic morivation (0.3\u00f3). The academic self-concept in turn become less important in determining intrinsic motivation (0.48 at T1 and 0.19 at T2). As expected, the environmenral changes connec\u00eeed to the transition emphasise the importance of the competence self-concept in orienting the different aspecrs of the self-system.\nIn this model, school grades at Tl are predicted by academic self-concept (0.51) and amotivation (-0.29). Furthermore, school grades at Tl significantly affect amotivation levels and the academic sel\u00c8concept at T2 (-0.34 and 0.28, respectively, see e.g. Rosenberg et al., 1995). School grades af T2 are predicted by school grades at Tl (0.56) and by academic self-concept atT2 (0.35). Amotivation loses imponance in affecting final school grades from Tl to T2.\nThe results confirm the initial hypothesis that achievemenr motivation at T2 is not greatly affected by the academic sel\u00c8concept, but is more generally influenced by the feeling of performing successfully in the new situation. This new setting requires the children to respond to many different requests at several levels (not only at the 0.56 -0'19 0.36 -0.17, Competence self-concept 2 academic one). In conclusion, following the transition, the different components within the self-system tend ro assume dissimilar loads in their reciprocal relationships. The academic self-concept is of greater importance at T1 than at T2 n orientating achievement motivation and determining academic performance. On the other hand, the competence self-concept is of greater significance at T2 than at Tl with regard to achievement motivation.",

      "text": "This longitudinal study has highlighted areas of both stability and change in the transition from primary school to secondary school. It has also enabled us to const\u00eeuct a dynamic model of the influences of self-system on academic achievement. \\/hile confirming that the self-system is instrumental in achieving academic success at both ages (Bouffard, 1998), our model allows us to consider directly the links between the individual aspects of this construction and the differential influences of the variables considered on school results at the two age levels. \\7ith regard to the changes over the period of time considered, our results partially confirm the trends reponed in the literature.\nParallel to the fall in school results, the school self-concept of young adolescents becomes more negative, confirming the tendency already observed in various studies on the transition from primary to lower middle school (for a review of the literature, see Roeser & Eccles, 1998) and suggesting the presence in the older pupils of a more realistic self-concept, corresponding to the more severe assessments given by their teachers,\nThere is also a significant fall in intrinsic motivation among first-year secondaryschool pupils. Some aurhors have found a link between type of motivation (sel\u00c8determined or other-determined) and pupils' perception of teachers' autonomy supportiveness or control. Pupils' perceptions of teachers' autonomy supportiveness were positively associated with intrinsic motivation, although their perceptions of teacher control were positively associated with lack of motivation (Deci er al.' l99l). Roeser & Eccles (1998) found that the more teachers thought given individuals were good pupils, the more those pupils valued school over the course of time. In other words, the academic self-concept, which is also based on the opinion that other people have about academic performance, affects school motivation.\nVe have already seen how attempts to offer a global explanation for such changes have at different times focused attention on different features: either mainly on individual developmental aspects or mainly on environmental changes. As various authors (Seidman et al., 1994;Vigfield et al., 1996) have pointed out, over the last decade the deztelopmental stage-enoironmental fit model has prevailed. This model tries to explain negative changes in different domains of the self-system in the light of interaction between individual and contextual components: the mismatch between the developmental needs of early adolescents and the demands of the new social environment (characterised as large, anonymous and with a greater control function over student behaviour) seems to be responsible for the decline in the self-system.\nOur results fail to show, however, the increase in exuinsic motivation predicted and registered in the literature (Harter, 1981). Nevertheless, the emergence of links between this motivational orientation and the examined dimensions of sel\u00c8concept suggests the growing importance with age of exuinsic motivation in the general self-system, which needs to be explored using longitudinal schemes over a longer time Self-concept, Motioation and Achievement 2L5 frame. \\\u00f9\u00edith regard to the reciprocal influences between variables involved in steering the pupil towards academic success) our model suggests the following points:\n1. As expected, academic self-concept influences school results at the first and second age level, and intrinsic motivation in the last year of primary school, which partly confirms findings in the literature (Harter et al., 7992t Losier & Vallerand, 1994); 2. However, the picture changes at the second school level, where another aspect of sel\u00c8concept has a substantial effect on motivational orientation: the competence at controlling the environment. After the transition and probably as a consequence of environmental changes and the attendant breakdown of the social network, the component of the self-system, which Bouffard (1998) defines as perceived conuol over success and failure and which concerns the efficient functioning of the individual in various spheres (Bracken, 1992) begins to predominate; 3. Finally, intrinsic motivational orientation has no direct influence on school results at the age levels under consideration, while lack of motivation has a negative impact on these results, but only at the first level. It is possible that the differential effect of intrinsic motivational orientation on success at school suggested by other authors (Deci & Ryan, 1985;Corbi\u00e8re, 1997) is not yet evident at the age levels under consideration. The importance of these considerations is all the greater in view of the imminent restnrcfi.rring of school levels to be introduced as pan of a planned general reform of Italy's school system. lVhile it is important that schools should make pupils aware of their limits, it is also vital that they also help them to consolidate their self-esteem. This would avoid the danger faced by students at all age levels of falling into the twin uap of low academic achievement and lack of motivation.\nConespondmce.'Mirella Zanobini, Sezione di Psicologia, DiSA, Universit\u00e0 di Genova, Vico S.
