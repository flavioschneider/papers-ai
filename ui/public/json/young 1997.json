  "abstract": "Finding ways to enhance the effectiveness of student learning is of perennial interest to researchers and practitioners alike. One approach to these issues has been to examine the relations between motivation and cognition over time. In addition, it is likely that students perceptions of the classroom context may play a role in facilitating effective learning. The current study examines these issues from a goal orientation theory perspective using a sample of middle school students (n = 306). Data on students' personal motivational beliefs and cognitive strategy use as well as perceptions of the classroom goal structures were gathered using surveys. A longitudinal design was used to examine the research questions. Results suggest that motivation and cognition are reciprocally related over time. In addition, perceptions of classroom context were found to have an explanatory effect over and above the variance explained by prior measures of motivation and cognition. The implications for this work include the notion that student motivation can be enhanced through instruction in cognitive strategy use as well as through alteration of classroom goal structures so that there is a stronger emphasis on tasks and learning rather than on grades or external recognition. A key issue for teachers, parents and administrators alike involves the role of student motivation in the learning process. Most often, we believe that students must",

Laments such as \"These students just aren't motivated!\" abound, suggesting that students lack the traits that make motivated behavior and learning beyond basic skill acquisition possible. Motivation must precede cognition. Alternatively, certain kinds of cognition may influence motivation much the way having the right tools for the home improvement project may make the job more approachable and efficient. Finally, cognition and motivation may reciprocally related, each influencing the other over time. While this last notion makes a great deal of sense, it has not been empirically examined.\nAt the same time, there has been an increasing interest in the role that the classroom context plays in influencing the relations between student motivation and strategy use. Questions such as \"How can I motivate my students?\" imply that there is something that teachers and parents can do differently in order to mediate the processes of motivation and cognition. The assumption is that features of the environment can provide motivational cues for students. Ultimately, the question is what are some effective ways to influence student motivation?\nThough motivation can be characterized in a variety of ways, one theoretical approach, goal orientation theory (Ames 1992;Maehr 1989), has become an effective way to explore these concerns. Goal orientation theory suggests that the questions be refocused from \"How much motivation?\"\nto \"Wow is the student motivated?\" In refocusing the question, research in goal orientation theory suggests that the quality of student motivation effects the kinds of cognitive strategies students use (Nolen 1988;Nolen & Haladyna 1990). This theoretical perspective has also identified a set of environmental structures (i.e., policies and practices teachers use which have been shown to convey motivational emphases to students (Ames 1992;Ames & Archer 1988)) which provide cues for student motivation. The present study examines the importance of these classroom goal structures as viewed by students, on the change in both personal goal orientations and cognitive strategy use.",

This theoretical approach is concerned with students' reasons, purposes, or goals for achieving in school (Ames 1987(Ames , 1992Urdan & Maehr 1995). Goal orientation, or how students approach a particular goal, is the main organizing construct in goal theory. For example, a student may strive to do well in a given class. The goal is to do well, but the reason for holding that goal may differ. For one student, doing well may indicate that his or her purpose is to master the material, while for another it may mean he or she wants to out-perform other students, and for a third it might mean striving to get high grades. The research within goal theory has generated empirical evidence that these orientations are related to motivational behaviors such as persistence, effort, and task choice. In addition, these orientations have an empirically demonstrated effect on the kind of cognitive strategies students are likely to employ.",

      "heading": "TASK-FOCUSED ORIENTATION",
      "text": "Early work in goal theory presented a model of motivation with two predominant goal orientations: task and performance (Ames & Ames 1984). These two constructs, task and performance goal orientation, appear throughout the achievement goal theory literature, though they are not consistently operationalized in the same manner (see Urdan & Maehr 1995, for a review)'. Students who hold a \"taskfocused\" goal orientation are interested in developing competencies and in leaming as an end in itself. Students with this orientation tend to work hard, choose challenging tasks and persist in the face of difficulty (Ames 1987;Dweck 1986;Maehr 1989;Nicholls 1984). Of particular interest are the studies indicating that students' goal orientation is related to the quality of their cognitive strategy use. Experimental studies as well as studies using self-report data have found that students who held a task-focused goal orientation were more likely to value and use cognitive processing strategies which required a deeper level of encoding than were students who held a performance-orientation (Graham & Golan 1991;Nolen 1988). Other work has found that students who held a task-focused goal orientation were likely to employ deeper cognitive and self-regulatory strategies such as linking new information to prior knowledge, making connections with everyday phenomena, monitoring comprehension, and identifying main ideas (Anderman & Young 1994;Pintrich & DeGroot 1990;Pintrich, Roeser, & DeGroot 1994).\nIn contrast, students who hold a \"performance-focused\" goal orientation are interested in demonstrating competency and in learning as a means to an end. Students with this orientation are generally concerned with grades and test scores as well as with outperforming others, and being considered the best student (Ames 1987;1992;Dweck & Leggett 1988). These students were likely to employ surface level processing strategies, such as memorization, guessing, or writing down the first thing that comes to mind in order to finish the task quickly (Ames & Archer 1988;Elliott & Dweck 1988;Nicholls, Cobb, Wood, Yackel, & Patashnick 1990;Nolen 1988;Nolen & Haladyna 1990).",

Recent research in motivation has suggested a reciprocal relation between motivation and cognition (e.g., Pintrich, Roeser, & DeGroot 1994). It is likely that motivation and cognition act in a more mutually influential fashion where motivation influences the quality of cognition at the same time that cognition influences the quality of motivation. This idea of reciprocity has been implied by social cognitive as well as socio-cultural approaches to learning and development (Butler & Winne 1995;Pintrich & Garcia 1991;Rogoff 1990;Pintrich, Roeser, & De Groot 1994;Sivan 1986). However, this reciprocity between motivation and strategic learning has not been examined empirically to any great extent within either theoretical approach. Thus, a primary question for this study concerns the reciprocal relations between motivation, conceptualized in terms of students' goal orientation, and cognition, conceptualized as cognitive strategy use. Using a twowave design with motivation and cognition measured at both time points, it is expected that motivational orientation at time one will influence cognitive strategy use at time two and that cognitive strategy use at time one will influence motivational orientation at time two.",

      "heading": "THE IMPACT OF CLASSROOM GOAL STRUCTURE",
      "text": "Another aspect of goal orientation theory involves the assumption that motivational orientation can be influenced by the classroom context. For example, Dweck and Leggett (1988) found that subjects' motivational orientation could be manipulated via the laboratory context. Ames and Archer (1988) found that students motivational orientation was influenced by certain dimensions of the classroom context (i.e., task, authority, recognition, grouping, evaluation, and time). More recently, Maehr andMidgley (1991, 1996) examined this contextual influence at the school-wide level, finding that policies and practices at this level have an effect on student motivation and learning.\nThis idea is paralleled in the literature on classroom climate, which has examined students' perceptions of classrooms. For example, Trickett and Moos (1973) argue that classroom climate variables add significantly to the explained variance in student attitudes and reactions. Moreover, in a review of the classroom environment literature, Fraser (1991) argues that students' perceptions of the classroom environment account for significant amounts of variance over and above the variance explained by student background variables. Fraser, Treagust, and Dennis (1986) argue that perceptions can be viewed as determinants of behavior, implying that perceptions might influence beliefs and goals as well as strategies. In a goal theory framework, the dominant themes of task-focused and performancefocused can be mapped onto dimensions of the classroom, which will be termed classroom goal structures. These goal structures are policies, practices, and procedures that have been shown to change the motivational environment of the classroom (Ames 1990;1992;Ames & Archer 1988;Maehr & Midgley 1991). Though most classroom goal structures are not strictly task-or performancefocused, students may perceive an emphasis on one or the other.",

      "text": "In schools, students perceive information which can emphasize different reasons for engaging in classroom tasks (Ames & Archer 1988;Maehr & Midgley 1996). For example, teachers who allow students some choice of tasks, who assign meaningful tasks, who allow for revision, and who emphasize the importance of effort are apt to create an environment with a more task-focused goal structure. The emphasis here is on the nature of the work and the individual student's progress, which is likely to give students the sense that attention to tasks is of importance in these classrooms.\nRecent empirical work in goal theory has found that students' personal goals are affected by their perceptions of the classroom goal structure (Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan 1996). These personal goals, in turn, are related to the level of cognitive strategies students tend to use (Nolen 1988;Nolen & Haladyna 1990). This means that if students perceive the salient dimensions of the classroom as having a predominantly task-focused goal structure, they are more likely to adopt a personal task-focused goal orientation. For example, if students see that they are VOLUME 9, NUMBER 3.1997 likely to be recognized on the basis of effort and improvement, then they are apt to be oriented to the nature of their work rather than the reward itself.",

      "text": "In contrast, teachers who allow little or no choice of tasks, who assign tasks requiring low level cognitive processing, who group students according to ability, and who publicly acknowledge the results of evaluations are apt to create an environment with a more performance-focused goal structure. These teachers make the issue of ability salient through public comparisons and the emphasis becomes the demonstration of ability, rather than learning the material being presented. This is likely to give students the sense that the goal in these classrooms is to outperform others or simpIy get high grades (Ames 1992;Maehr & Midgley 1991). In these environments, students are more likely to adopt a personal extrinsic or relative ability goal orientation if they perceive the classroom goal structure to be performance-focused.\nFor example, if students see that they are likely to be recognized and rewarded on solely the basis of high grades or only in relation to other students, then they are apt to be oriented to the reward rather than the content of the task. In these types of environments, students may be more likely to adopt a personal extrinsic goal orientation or relative ability goal orientation. Holding an extrinsic goal orientation has been linked to higher levels of surface processing (Pintrich & Schrauben 1992).\nAt the same time, it is acknowledged that classrooms probably do not manifest dimensions centered only within one goal structure or another. Rather, certain dimensions may be structured in a way that presents salient information about the reasons for doing work. Perceptions of the classroom goal structures may be influenced by individual differences in motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use. In turn, these perceptions are then likely to have an effect on motivational and cognitive outcomes. Previous work in goal orientation theory has not examined the potential for students' classroom perceptions of the classroorrr goal structure to mediate personal goal orientation and cognitive strategy use. Thus, certain environments or situations may be seen as relating to different patterns of motivation, thereby mediating the individual student's motivational orientation. In statistical terms, a mediational factor is expected to significantly reduce the relation between the predictor variable and outcome variable (Baron & Kenny 1986). This means that students' perceptions of the classroom are expected to influence the personal goal orientation above and beyond what is explained by prior personal goal orientation.",

      "heading": "DOMAIN DIFFERENCES",
      "text": "One aspect of the classroom envirol~ment centers on the domain, or subject area.\nThere is evidence to suggest that subject matter has an influence over the development of curriculum and the nature of instruction in secondary school teachers (Grossman Q Stodolsky 1994Siskin 1994). For example, secondary math and foreign language teachers were more likely to characterize their subject as static, clearly defined, and hierarchical, than were English, social studies, and science teachers . This difference in structural characteristics of content may lead to differences in the kinds of work students are presented with along with the general instructional policies and the sequencing of concepts in these classrooms. Thus, these assumptions about content might lead math classrooms to present more salient performance goal structures than English classrooms, while English classrooms might present a more salient task goal structure.\nThe nature of instruction within subject areas may itself be a factor in students' motivational orientation (Stodolsky 1988;Stodolsky, Salk, & Glaessner 1991;Young, Arbreton, & Midgley 1992). For example, Stodolsky (1988) found that while teaching math, fifth grade teachers in self-contained classrooms were more likely to employ individual seatwork as the primary instructional format with few cooperative activities and little variety in instructional materials. Subsequent work found that the instructional patterns in social studies and math influenced students' thinking in those subject areas. In particular, students tended to view math in terms of success or failure and in terms of ease or difficulty of work, while social studies was seen on a continuum of boring to interesting (Stodolsky, Salk, & Glaessner 1991). Such cues have an obvious connection with students' motivational beliefs.\nThese issues begin to arise at the middle and junior high school level when schools typically become departmentalized and subject matter issues become more salient than they have been at the elementary level. The work of Wigfield, Eccles and their colleagues has addressed these issues by examining math and English using an expectancy-value perspective (Wigfield, Eccles, MacIver, Reuman, & Midgley 1991). Recently, the effects of subject area have been systematically examined in goal theory (Anderman & Young 1993;Wolters, Yu, & Pintrich 1996;Young, Arbreton, & Midgley 1992). These studies found evidence for mean-level differences on measures of task and ability goal orientation across different academic subject areas (i.e., English, math, social studies, science). For example, Young, Arbreton, and Midgley (1992) found mean-level differences in the motivational and strategic learning constructs. In another study, Anderman and Young (1993) found that different subject areas presented different levels of between-classroom variance in motivational constructs. Finally, Wolters, Yu, and Pintrich (1996) examined patterns of relations across three academic subject areas. They found mean-level differences in motivational constructs across subject areas, but failed to find differences in patterns of relations in each subject area, concluding that there may be generalizable models of the relations between motivational and strategic learning constructs.\nSince there is not enough research to present conclusive evidence on this issue of patterns of relations, a third research question involves the relations between motivational orientation, cognitive strategy use, and student perceptions of the classroom within particular subject areas. It is expected that math classes would be perceived as more performance goal structured than English classes because math classroom environments are often designed to focus on students' attention on test grades, correct answers and comparison to other students than do English classes. In addition, it is expected that the patterns of relations among the various motivational orientation and strategic learning constructs will differ by subject area.",

For instance, studies have reported that girls more than boys tend to: use unstable, internal attributions to explain success in mathematics (Eccles, MacIver, & Lange 1986;Ryckman & Peckham 1987;Wigfield, Eccles, MacIver, Reuman, & Midgley 1991); exhibit performance-oriented behavior in experimental situations involving math (Dweck 1986); and have low self-efficacy and self concept of ability in mathematics (Eccles,Adler,& Meece 3984). Also, some studies in goal theory report that boys more than girls are likely to report higher levels of performance goal orientation (Hicks, Murphy & Patrick 1995;Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan, 1996;Yoon & Eccles 1996). Finally, recent work has posited that males and females show different patterns in the relations between goal orientation and learning (Pintrich, Ryan, & Patrick 1996). Brush (1980) interviewed girls regarding their mathematics and English classes, finding that participants described English classes as having more student-teacher interaction, positive emotional support, and controlled public recitation. In Eccies' work, she and her colleagues (Eccles et al. 1986a) have identified classrooms which would be deemed \"girl unfriendly,\" typically math classes, in which instructional practices enhance competition among students, involve public evaluation of ability during recitation-type instruction, encourage social comparison based on ability assessment, and involve the differentiated use of praise.\nGiven these findings, it is IikeIy that males and females might find different environmental features salient. In turn, these perceptual differences might then lead to differences in adoption of personal goal orientation. For example, if girls are more likely to see the performance structures in math classrooms, it may mean that they are more likely to adopt extrinsic or relative ability goal orientation in math.\nIn sum, the primary questions addressed in this study are:\n1. What is the relation between students' goal orientation and cognitive strategy use over the course of two years of middle school? Prior research shows that taskgoal orientation is positively related to deeper cognitive strategy use. It is anticipated that this finding will be replicated in the current study. Likewise, extrinsic goal orientation at time one should be negatively related to deeper strategy use at time two. Given the recent findings in goal theory, it is expected that relative ability goal orientation at time one will be positively related to deeper strategy use at time two. Finally, it is hypothesized that deeper cognitive strategy use at time one will be positively related to students' task goal orientation at time two.\n2. How do perceptions of the classroom goal structure mediate these relations? Given the literature on goal theory and on classroom environments, it is expected that students' perceptions of the classroom goal structure will be related to their personal goal orientation at time two. For instance, perceiving the classroom as task goal structured should be positively related to both personal task goal orientation and deeper strategy use at time two. Conversely, perceiving the classroom as performance structured should be positively related to personal extrinsic goal orientation and negatively related to personal task goal orientation and deeper strategy use at time two. Also, it is expected that students' perceptions of the classroom goal structure will have an effect over and above prior goal orientation and deeper cognitive strategy use.\n3. Do these relations differ by the curricular context (i.e., the subject matter; English, math)? First, it is expected that there will be mean-level differences on the motivational and strategic learning constructs. Then, it is anticipated that the patterns among the relations between goals and cognitive strategy use will differ by subject area context, with math classrooms having a stronger emphasis on performance structures and English classrooms having a stronger emphasis on task structures.\n4. Finally, do these relations differ by gender? First, it is anticipated that there will be mean-level gender differences on the motivational and strategic learning constructs. It is also expected that males and females will show different patterns among these relations, with girls seeing the math classrooms as more strongly performance structured than boys.\nIn sum, question one examines the relations between motivation and cognition over time, expecting reciprocity between the motivational and cognitive constructs. The second question follows by examining the mediational effects of perceptions of the classroom goal structures on the relations between motivation and cognition at time one and time two. Question three addresses the potential domain differences in the patterns of relations among these constructs. Finally, question four explores gender differences in these relations.",

Eliciting student perceptions of the classroom environment through such self-report measures is a useful tool in exploring the interaction between the individual and the environment (Fraser 1991). Student self-report measures allow researchers to identify shared perceptions of a classroom which may involve long-standing issues and aspects of the environment which may not be evident to an outside observer (Ames 1992;Fraser, Treagust, & Dennis 1986;Trickett & Moos 1973). In addition, self-report measures are more economical than are classroom observations or videotaping methods of data collection.\nSurveys were administered to students in their classrooms by trained graduate research assistants and were read aloud to account for variability in students' reading abilities. The measure, known as the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey (PALS), was developed for a larger project (Midgley, Maehr, & Urdan 1993). The survey was comprised of original items as well as items adapted from a variety of sources (e.g., Ames 1990; Ames & Archer 1988;Harter 1981;Maehr & Braskamp X986;Maehr & Fyans 1989;Nicholls, Patashnick, Cheung, Thorkildsen, & Lauer 1989;Nolen & Haladyna 1990;Pintrich & DeGroot 1990;Weinstein, Palmer & Schulte 1987). Students responded to the items using a 5-oint Likert scale (1 = Not at all True of Me, 5 = Very True of Me.\nThis study focused on six constructs from the survey: task-focused goal orientation, extrinsic-focused goal orientation, relative ability-focused goal orientation, use of deeper cognitive strategies (measured at both Time 1 and Time 2), and students' perceptions of the classroom goal structures as performance-focused and as task-focused (at Time 2 only). In the PALS survey (see Appendix A), the measure of deeper cognitive strategy use is most closely representative of self-regulation strategies as well as organizational and elaborative strategies.\nThe latter two scales measure students' perceptions of the purposes of doing academic work which may be emphasized in their classes. For instance, in a task goal structured classroom there would be an emphasis on meaningful learning activities that are interesting to students; a focus on opportunites for self-management and support for various learning strategies; an emphasis on recognition and rewards based on individual improvement and effort (Ames 1992;Ames & Archer 1988;Maehr & Midgley 1991). In contrast, in a performance goal structured classroom there would be an emphasis on standard tasks; a focus on control and discipline; and an emphasis on social comparisons based on grades and test scores as well as external rewards and recognition (Ames 1992;Ames & Archer 1988;Maehr & Midgley 1991).\nIn addition, each of these constructs was measured in both English and mathematics. Scales were formed using factor analysis and items and reliabilities are presented in Appendix A. Reliability statistics were all acceptable, ranging from a = .71 to a = .88 in English and a = .67 to a = 32 in math.",

Differences between models tested with this formula will be systematically attenuated because of the nested nature of the data (i.e., measures nested within students).\nExtrinsic\nTherefore, the following discussion has been restricted to just those differences which emerged despite underestimated effects. For instance, the relation between task goal orientation at time one and task goal orientation at time two was stronger in math than it was in English (t = 2.17**). Students appeared more likely to strengthen their orientations and cognitive strategy use in math than they were in English.\nIn terms of the math model (see Figure 2) it appeared that relations between variables at time one and time two were more elaborate, with more predictive relations. Students who reported a stronger task-focused goal orientation tended to report lower levels of extrinsic (1s = -.18) and relative ability goal orientation (f3 = -.15) at time two.

For instance, in the math model, deeper cognitive strategy use at time one had a moderate, positive relation with perceptions of the classroom as task structured (iZ = .25).

These relations explained 11% of the variance in perceptions of performance structure in the math model, while no time one predictors were related to perceptions of performance goal structure in English.\nIn contrast, the English model (see Figure 1) showed relations between perceptions of the classroom as task structured and relative ability-focused goal orientation (G = .28) as well as deeper strategy use (t3 = .54) at time two, which were stronger than those in the math model (B = .12, f = 1.88*; 1l = .34; t = 3.59***). It is interesting to note that perceiving the classroom as task structured predicted holding a relative ability-focused goal orientation, as this is contrary to the theoretical framework in goal theory.\nPerceptions of the classroom as having a performance-focused orientation positively influenced extrinsic (fX = .20) and relative ability-focused (is = .26) goal orientation, as well as deeper cognitive strategy use (rS = .12) at time two. Perceptions of the classroom as having a performance-focused goal orientation was moderately, positively related to personal extrinsic-focused goal orientation at time two (B = .24). It is interesting to note that both math and English modets showed this positive relation between perceptions of the classroom as performance structured and personal extrinsic-focused goal orientation at time two. This finding is consistent with what would be expected by goal theory, reflecting the notion that emphasizing performance aspects of the classroom might encourage students to adopt a more extrinsic-focused goal orientation. In comparing the variance explained in the time two variables, the English model ranged from 28% for extrinsic-focused goal orientation to 46% for deeper cognitive strategy use. In math, the variance explained ranged from 32% for relative ability goal orientation to 39% for deeper strategy use. Because R-squared is a ratio, it was possible to use an F-statistic to test for the significance of differences between the adjusted R-squares in the English and math models (Cohen & Cohen 1983;Hinkle, Weirsma, & Jurs 1988). The math model explained significantly more variance in extrinsic focused goal orientation (Adjusted R-squared = .39) than did the English model (Adjusted R-squred = .28; F = 6.10). In contrast, the English model explained significantly more variance in deeper strategy use at time two (Adjusted R-squared = .39) than did the math model (Adjusted Rsquared = .39; F = 8.20). This means that the math model provides a better fit for extrinsic goal orientation, while the English model provides a better fit for deeper strategy use.\nIn general, prior goal orientation and cognitive strategy use was more likely to affect perceptions of the classroom as performance structured in math than in English, while it appeared that perceptions of the classroom as task structured had stronger effects in English than in math. Thus, in math classrooms, students may rely on prior goal orientation and cognitive strategy use. In English classrooms students may rely more on cues from the classroom environment.\nBecause boys and girls were found to perceive the classroom goal structures differently, the next step required separate path analyses by gender to determine whether the pattern of effects was the same. In the case of both English (see Figures 3 and 4) and math (see Figures 5 and 6), the general pattern of effects was different for boys and girls, with boys showing more relations among extrinsicfocused goal orientation, relative ability goal orientation, and perceptions of performance goal structure in the classroom. Figures three through six present the gender-specific models for English and math.\nFor English, the model for girls (see Figure 3) presented a moderate, positive path between task-focused goal orientation at time one and perceptions of the classroom as task strcutred at time two (is = .38). No such path was found in the model for boys (see Figure 4). This indicated that girls who showed a stronger task focused goal orientation were likely to see the classroom as being more task structured, while boys' prior goal orientation had no bearing on how they saw the classroom goal structure. Also, the model for boys showed a low, positive relation between perceptions of the classroom performance structured and deeper strategy use (B = .14), while no such relation existed in the model for girls. This means that boys who reported seeing the classroom as having a stronger performance structure were more likely to report using deeper cognitive strategies, while girls'",

      "text": "The question of how students' academic goals and strategy use change over time is a relatively new area of interest in goal theory (c.f., Anderman & Midgley 1996;Hicks 1996). This study adds to our understanding demonstrating both the pattern of change and the relations between goal orientation and cognitive strategy use over time. It appears that goal orientation and strategy use have some stability. In other words, students who report holding a strong task-focused goal orientation in the sixth grade are more likely to report a stronger task-focused goal orientation in the seventh grade. This suggests that to some degree, these individual differences are carried with the student from year to year.\nIn terms of the question of goal orientation influencing cognitive strategy use over time, none of the goal orientations related to an increase in deep strategy use. This finding was unexpected as goal theory (Maehr & Midgley 1991;Nolen 1988;Nolen & Haladyna 1990) would have predicted that those students with stronger extrinsic focused goal orientation at time one would actually decline in deeper strategy use at time two. Similarly, students with stronger relative ability goal orientation would lose some degree of deeper strategy use at time two. Two factors in this finding are the strong within time correlation between the three goal orientations and deeper strategy use as well as the autocorrelations of these variables across time. It is likely that these constructs are accounting for similar variance in the hierarchical regressions.\nIn only one case was an increase in deeper strategy use related to task-focused goal orientation. In the English model, deeper strategy use at time one had a direct positive effect on task-focused goal orientation at time two (13 = .22***). This result suggests that, in English, students who employ deeper strategies might be more inclined to increase or adopt a task-focused goal orientation in future situations. One interpretation of this is that having the deeper strategies to perform the work in English classes is likely to make the work more intrinsically interesting. This would be a case where students who have the skills can consider the work in a different motivational light.",

      "text": "This study also examined the mediating effects of students' perceptions of the classroom goal orientation. It was hypothesized that students' perceptions of the classroom would provide a mediating effect for these motivational and cognitive constructs. If so, the classroom perception variables would change the relations between the independent and dependent variables by taking some of the explanatory power from the independent variables (Baron & Kenny 1986; 274 LEARNlNGANDINDIVlLWALDlFFERENCES VOLUME 9. NUMBER 3,1997 Ryan & Pintrich 1997). The results of this study suggest that students' perceptions of the classroom goal structure have an impact over and above personal goals and strategies. Two partially mediated relations were evident here. First, personal task-focused goal orientation at time one and two was mediated by perceptions of the classroom as task-focused in English. Second, the impact of deeper strategy use at time one was reduced after accounting for students' perceptions of the classroom as task-focused in math (see Table 4a & b). This finding is congruent with normative goal theory, which argues that students' perceptions of context affects students' goal orientation (Ames & Archer 1988;Dweck & Leggett 1986;Nicholls 1984;Maehr & Midgley 1991;Pintrich & DeGroot 1990;Pintrich, Roeser & DeGroot 1994).\nPerceptions of the classroom goal structure show additive effects on the relations between motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use at times one and two. In other words, perceptions of the classroom goal structure tended to focus the students' existing goal orientation. More specifcially, perceptions of the classroom as task goal structured had a significantly positive effect on deeper strategy use (see Figures 14). These effects were strong, ranging from .54 and .39 in the general models to .56 to .26 in the gender and subject specific models. This means that students who saw the classroom as emphasizing effort, improvement and learning in general, were more likely to report using deeper cognitive strategies.\nThese results suggest that students' entering level of goal orientation and deeper strategy use affect their perceptions of the classroom and subsequently influence changes in both goal orientation and deeper strategy use. For example, students who enter seventh grade using deeper cognitive strategies might see their classroom as more task-focused and this perception may influence their personal taskfocused goal orientation making it even stronger than it would have otherwise been. Having the \"skills\" or tools to learn effectively might enhance students' perceptions of the classroom goals in that a task-focused structure provides a mechanism through which personal task-focused goal orientation might be amplified. As a result, there would be concern for helping students to gain the necessary skills in order for them to see the task-focused aspects of the classroom. Similarly, perceiving one's classroom as more task structured alters the relations between time one and time two task-focused goal orientation. If students already have a personal orientation towards task goals, they may be more likely to see the classroom as having a task goal structure, which will then lead to further personal task goal orientation.\nIt is interesting to note that there were few significant relations between time one variables and perceptions of the classroom goal orientation. At time two, there are a number of significant relations between perceptions of the classroom goal structure and motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use variables indicates that there are strong contextual effects in each of these models. This is a promising finding for two reasons. First, the use of classroom perception variables adds another dimension to our understanding of motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use because it accounts for students' experience of the classroom goal orientation (Fraser 1991).\nSecond, this finding provides more evidence that students' perceptions of teachers' instructional policies and practices can have a direct effect on student motivation (Ames & Archer 1988;Maehr & Midgley 1991). The power of goal theory is that the classroom environment can be manipulated to emphasize one goal orientation over another, thus affecting a group of students rather than working with individuals separately. Further research will be needed to clarify how the various instructional policies and practices are construed by students. This finding supports this idea, presenting an assessment of the independent effects of perceptions of classroom goal orientation on students' personal goal orientation and cognitive strategy use.\nFor example, earlier work in goal theory created the TARGET model (tasks, authority, reward, grouping, evaluation and time) which dealt primarily with issues of the impact of classroom-level policies and practices on motivation in the elementary classroom. It will be necessary to explore the middle level and high schools to determine the issues for those levels of schooling. One way to do this effectively will be to begin investigating these policies and practices at the department-level Siskin 1994), in addition to using a school-wide approach (Maehr & Midgley 1991). The school-wide approach may be most effective for elementary level schools, whereas secondary classrooms are nested in departmental contexts. Regardless, what these results suggest is that context matters.",

      "text": "The third question this study attempted to address was to identify contextual differences among the motivational and cognitive relations within the English and math subject areas. At this level of context, there were few differences between the English and math models. One difference was that there was a direct effect of time one deeper cognitive strategy use on time two task-focused goal orientation in English and not in math. One interpretation of this finding is that students may have more opportunities for things like revision and for spending time considering how to do the work in English classes than they do in math classes. There may be more opportunities to use deeper strategies in English, which would influence subsequent personal task goals. Also, there may be more variability in English classes than in math classes.\nAnother difference was that personal motivational orientations and cognitive strategy use were less affected by perceptions of classroom goal orientation in the math than they were in the English model. The English model showed more relations between perceptions of the classroom and motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use at time two, particularly for perceptions of the classroom as ability-focused, than did the math model. This may indicate that in the math context there is more stability in beliefs and strategy use than in English. This may be because math curricula tend to be seen as more hierarchical and static than English (Grossman & Stodolsky 1994Siskin 1994;  ricula, so it might be easier to maintain patterns of beliefs and cognitive strategy use over time.\nIt is possible that the items used to create the scales for task goal orientation and deeper strategy use may have been geared more toward the English subject area than toward the math. The bivariate relation between these two constructs was strongly positive at both time one (r = .72) and time two (r = .79). Students may see some of these items as addressing similar issues, indicating that cognitive strategy use and motivational orientation are tapping perceptions or beliefs about work in English class.\nThis finding also raises a measurement issue with regard to the most effective way to capture the \"essence\" of beliefs and strategies in context. In this work, the items were parallel in English and math. Further research might consider this issue carefully because we may come to know more about the relation between motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use by investigating the particular instructional practices and policies of a subject area.",

      "text": "The remaining research question involved the issue of gender differences. The results of this study provide us with insights on the differences in patterns of relations between motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use for boys and girls. To begin with, the current research found that girls more than boys tend to perceive the classroom as having a task-focused goal orientation, while boys more than girls tend to perceive the classroom as having an performance goal orientation (see Table 2).\nAlso, the models for boys tended to show more relations between extrinsicfocused and relative ability-focused goal orientations than did the models for girls. For instance, boys tend to report higher mean levels of extrinsic-focused goal orientation in sixth and seventh grade and of relative ability-focused goal orientation in sixth grade. It could be that boys may place more of an emphasis on these goals because they are socialized to be more immune to the negative effects of competitive classroom structure than are girls (Eccles, Adler & Midgley 1984;Meece & Eccles 1993). Hicks (1996) finds that boys' achievement goals are more inter-related than those of girls, for whom social goals are more related to achievement goals. Further research will be needed to clarify this issue.\nIn summary, this study adds to our understanding of the longitudinal relations between motivational orientation and cognitive strategy use as well as the role of perceptions of classroom goal orientation in influencing those relations. It has also helped to clarify issues of context and gender in these relations while leaving us with ideas for further research. It is apparent that for many of the questions for further research, it will be important to include more qualitative data. This is an argument supported by Blumenfeld (1992), who suggests that it is important to identify elements of motivation by going into classrooms and using observational and interview data.\nFinally, the implications for this work for teachers and schools are important. The results of this study could be influential at a variety of levels, from the classroom to the department to the school. First, it suggests that encouraging students to obtain \"skills\" could positively affect their motivation. Second, it argues that students' prior beliefs have some affect on their perceptions of the classroom goal orientation. Finally, these results both confirm the premise of goal theory as well as present a viable argument that teachers need to consider the independent effects of the classroom environment on students' motivational beliefs and cognitive strategy use.
