  "title": "A longitudinal study of psychological functioning and academic attainment at the transition to secondary school",
  "abstract": "This longitudinal study of adolescents in the first year of secondary school, examined the relationship between psychological functioning at the beginning of year 7 (mean age 11.25 years) with attainment at the end of year 7 (mean age 11.78 years). Depressive symptoms, school liking and conduct problems predicted lower attainment across time having controlled for the temporal stability in psychological functioning and attainment. School concerns predicted lower attainment for boys only, and the effects of depressive symptoms on later attainment were significantly stronger for boys compared to girls. School liking -and school concerns for boys -remained significant predictors of attainment when controlling for conduct problems. The transition to secondary school may represent a window of opportunity for developing interventions aimed at improving both pupil psychological functioning and attainment.Periods of transition are often stressful and can influence short and long-term psychological functioning (West, Sweeting, & Young, 2008). The World Bank World Development Report (2007) identifies the transition from primary or elementary to secondary or middle/junior high school as one of five transitions related to positive health outcomes for young people. This transition involves simultaneous changes in school environments, social interactions and academic expectations and involves a degree of anxiety for most pupils (Rice, Frederickson & Seymour, 2011). This transition usually occurs at the age of 11 years and coincides with other biological and social changes associated with the transition from childhood to adolescence. The primary-secondary transition can negatively affect pupils' adjustment in a number of ways, as shown by lower grades, low attendance, increased anxiety and conduct",

Academic attainment has well established associations with outcomes later in life such as occupational status, income and health (Mirowsky & Ross, 2003). We set out to test if academic attainment following transition is predicted by psychological functioning (emotional problems; affect towards school; conduct problems) at the start of secondary school. If psychological functioning does predict attainment following transition, it is a potential target for interventions rather than, or in addition to, academic attainment. Although there is literature that examines the association of psychological functioning with academic attainment (e.g. Ansary & Luthar, 2009;Burt & Roisman 2010;Hinshaw, 1992;Miech, Caspi, Moffitt, Wright & Silva, 1999;Moilanen, Shaw & Maxwell, 2010;van Lier et al., 2012) little, if any, focuses on associations around the period of transition to secondary school. We focus on the first year of secondary school as an important period of vulnerability during which schools may be able to implement interventions. Nearly all pupils express some concerns about moving to secondary school. For most, however, worries about transition appear to be temporary and decline during the first year (Lucey & Reay, 2000;Galton, Morrison & Pell, 2000;Rice, Frederickson & Seymour, 2011). Thus, pupils with persistent difficulties across the first year of secondary may represent a vulnerable group.",

      "text": "Research on the relationship between emotional problems and academic attainment has yielded inconsistent findings (e.g. Richards & Abbot, 2009). One possible reason for inconsistency is that emotional problems have been conceptualized and measured in different ways across studies. Considering emotional problems as a whole, a number of studies have failed to find significant associations with on-going academic attainment or competence both in childhood and through adolescence (e.g. Ansary & Luthar, 2009;Burt & Roisman 2010;Moilanen et al., 2010;van Lier et al., 2012).\nSpecifically regarding depression, a number of studies have found an association between depressive symptoms and attainment across adolescence both within and across time, controlling for baseline attainment (e.g. Fr\u00f6jd et al., 2008;Steele, Armistead & Forehand, 2000). However, the temporal direction of effects remains unclear with other studies reporting that lower attainment predicts increases in depressive symptoms (Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002). Most research focuses on adolescent depression and examines academic outcomes in late adolescence or early adulthood. Given that there are developmental differences in the prevalence, risk factor profile and aetiology of depressive symptoms during childhood, adolescence and adulthood (Jaffee et al., 2002;Rice, 2010), examining the relationship between depressive symptoms and attainment in early adolescence may give a different pattern of results which are more directly relevant to transition.\nFor anxiety, again, there is an inconsistent pattern of association. Several studies have found associations with lower academic attainment, but these have often investigated social anxiety rather than general anxiety (e.g. Van Armeringen, Mancini & Frarvolden, 2003;Weeks, Coplan & Kingsbury, 2009). One study which looked at different kinds of anxiety in childhood found generalized anxiety to be associated with a greater likelihood of graduating from high school (Borges et al., 2011). Indeed, a study of university students found that anxiety was associated concurrently with better academic performance, suggesting that worrying does not adversely affect attainment (Svanum & Zody, 2001). Instead, fear and apprehension associated with attainment during school transition may be best captured by affect or anxiety about school rather than a general index of anxiety. Separate examination of the effects of general anxiety, school anxiety and depression on academic attainment may help to clarify temporal associations. We hypothesized that depressive symptoms would show association with poorer academic attainment over time but that general anxiety would not.",

      "text": "Research illustrating the importance of school for psychological well-being includes evidence that interventions to change the school climate have positive effects on pupil psychological functioning and attainment (Battistich, Schaps & Wilson, 2004).\nSense of school community, including factors such as liking school and concerns about moving to secondary school are found to be associated with measures of mental health (Reddy, Rhodes & Mulhall, 2003;Shochet, Dadds, Ham & Montague, 2006;West et al., 2008;Rice et al., 2011). These may, therefore, also be an important target for transition interventions. However, findings regarding the relation between affect towards school and academic achievement have not been as conclusive and prospective, longitudinal research is needed (Hagborg, 1994;Irvin, Meece, Byun, Farmer & Hutchins, 2011). Despite the relative lack of prospective longitudinal research, on the basis of prior research, we hypothesized a bi-directional relationship between school affect and academic attainment. Pupils doing well academically are likely to have greater connectedness to school; positive school affect, in turn, is likely to promote greater engagement and motivation in school activities and work.",

      "heading": "Conduct problems",
      "text": "Evidence suggests that conduct problems have a stronger and more consistent influence on academic attainment at school in comparison to emotional problems (Kessler, Foster, Saunders & Stang, 1995;Richards & Abbot, 2009). Studies have shown that conduct problems increase the likelihood of underachievement from childhood through adolescence and young adulthood (Hinshaw, 1992;Miech et al., 1999;Moilanen et al., 2010). Unlike for emotional problems, the association between conduct problems and later academic attainment is well documented. However, the relationship has not specifically been examined at the transition to secondary school.\nNonetheless, we expected to observe a similar association whereby conduct problems at the transition would be associated with poorer subsequent academic attainment.\nAt least two methodological issues may explain inconsistencies in research findings on emotional problems and later school attainment. First, there has been variability in the definition of attainment. Epidemiological studies have tended to examine dichotomous variables of educational achievement or failure (e.g. leaving school without any formal qualifications) while other studies focus on pupil perceptions of schoolwork or academic motivation (e.g. self-reported GPA; Owens, Shippee & Hensel, 2008). While dichotomous measures of educational failure may fail to capture subtle effects on different aspects of academic attainment, there is also a need for measures of academic attainment that are not affected by shared method variance. This may be an issue when pupils report on both attainment and psychological functioning, given that children with current depressive symptoms under-estimate their academic ability compared to teachers and peers (Cole, Martin, Peeke, Seroczynski & Hoffman, 1998). Second, the length of follow-up in longitudinal studies could influence results. Masten and colleagues (2005) suggest that emotional problems could affect academic competence within short follow-up periods but not over longer periods of time, whereas the effects of conduct problems tend to be found for both. This likely stems from the fact that emotional problems are often episodic and may therefore exert transient influences on academic attainment (e.g. via impaired motivation or concentration).",

      "text": "The aim of this study was to examine the temporal relationships between psychological functioning and academic attainment in the first year of secondary school using a prospective, longitudinal research design that would address methodological issues identified from previous research. Our main research hypotheses were: (1) conduct problems would be associated with a decline in academic attainment; (2) depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, would be associated with a decline in attainment;\n(3) affect towards school would show reciprocal relationships with attainment.\nAnalyses proceeded in three steps. First, associations between academic attainment and three domains of psychological functioning were examined: (i) emotional problems (depression; general anxiety; school anxiety), (ii) affect towards school (school liking; school concerns) and (iii) conduct problems. Second, we tested for reciprocal effects operating between academic attainment and each index of psychological functioning. Cross-lagged models were used which adjust for stability in each construct across time and the association between constructs at the initial assessment. Third, assuming support for an association between conduct problems and academic attainment consistent with previous research, we simultaneously assessed relationships between emotional problems and affect towards school with conduct problems to identify the relative role of specific dimensions of psychological functioning in relation to academic attainment.\nConsistent with gender differences in levels of psychological functioning (Green, McGinnity, Meltzer, Ford, & Goodman, 2005) and academic attainment from the elementary school years to adolescence (Department for Children, Schools & Families, 2008;Snyder & Dillow, 2012), we also tested for gender differences in the magnitude of the associations.\nWe focused specifically on the first year of secondary school because this is a period that initially involves some apprehension for all pupils, which should decrease over time for the majority (Rice et al., 2011) and when schools can introduce interventions or screening programs with potentially greater success than later in pupils' secondary school career (Vitaro & Tremblay, 2008).",

In the present longitudinal study, the amount of missing data across study variables varied from 0 to 28%, with most missing data occurring at time 2 for assessments of emotional problems, conduct problems and affect towards school (24 to 28%). There was 10% missing data for academic attainment at time 2. Structural equation models were estimated using full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) in LISREL 8.50 (J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 2001). FIML estimation fits the model to the non-missing values for each observation, allowing the use of all cases including those with missing data (Widaman, 2006). It is appropriate for use when the amount of missing data is moderate or large (e.g. Widaman, 2006).\nA cross-lagged analytic approach was adopted. The advantage of this approach is the ability to control for stability in psychological functioning and attainment, and the association between these constructs at the initial assessment, while simultaneously testing whether effects are unidirectional or bidirectional (Kenny, 2004). Thus, these models assess the direction of influence across time, which is a crucial step in addressing questions of causality. The models are estimated throughout using manifest measures and all paths are tested simultaneously. This produces fully saturated models with no degrees of freedom; goodness of fit indices therefore cannot be estimated. We were primarily interested in the nature of the relationship between psychological functioning and academic attainment and how these associations might differ by gender, rather than in testing nested models of different theorised pathways of influence on a given variable. The fact that models were fully saturated was therefore not deemed an impediment to hypothesis testing.\nSubgroup comparison tests were employed to consider whether the magnitude of parameter estimates in each model was different for males and females and to check that there were no significant parameter differences between the two secondary schools.\nDifferences in parameter estimates were tested by examining the chi square statistic derived from models that constrained each path to be equal for boys and girls and comparing it to that derived from a model where all paths were free to vary between boys and girls. If the change in chi-square statistic is significant (i.e. greater or equal to 3.84 for 1df), this indicates a significant difference in the magnitude of the coefficient between groups.",

In contrast, for girls, these symptoms do not adversely affect attainment and for some measures even seem to be associated with better attainment. This is consistent with a number of clinical observations where although the prevalence of emotional problems tends to be lower in boys, boys with emotional problems have worse functional outcomes (Diamantopoulou, Verhulst & van der Ende, 2011;Dunn & Goodyer, 2006).",

      "text": "It is important to identify factors that could be targeted as part of interventions in schools to maximize opportunities for children to realize their academic potential.\nCurrent interventions in the UK range from Bridging Units which provide continuity between primary and secondary school curriculum (Galton, Gray & Ruddock, 2003) to those that focus on pupils identified as vulnerable by primary school teachers (Boyce & Frederickson, 2012). The present results suggest that interventions could be usefully extended to target other risk factors. Conduct problems, consistently showing associations with later academic attainment, may be a useful target at the beginning of secondary school to improve academic outcomes for pupils. School liking, and for boys, school concerns, are additional potential targets for interventions, showing associations with later attainment above and beyond the influence of conduct problems. Depressive symptoms may not predict poor achievement in school per se, but for boys, it may herald the beginning of a developmental pathway that leads to reduced academic attainment perhaps via associated reductions in school liking and/or increases in conduct problems. While conduct problems and school liking may be better targets for interventions at transition across both genders, depressive symptoms and school concerns in boys are a potential marker for subsequent academic problems and may represent a target group for specialized support.",

      "text": "First, we used self-report and peer-report questionnaires to assess psychological functioning in this study as opposed to clinical interview measures. This approach may mean that some of the associations reported here do not extend to young people with clinical disorders. Second, we included pupils from two mixed, non-selective schools in England and it is not yet clear to what extent these results will generalize to other schools and other countries. Nonetheless, US and UK research on school transition generally show similar patterns of association (e.g. Eccles et al., 1993). Third, there was some attrition across the course of the study, although there was no evidence of selective drop out.\nTwo features of the research design warrant discussion. First, the cross-lagged coefficients are open to the influence of measurement error. Associations in the cross-lagged paths may indicate stronger effects where one variable has greater stability and/or more reliable measurement. It is possible that this may explain our robust findings for conduct problems (given the measure combined self and peer ratings). However, our findings are consistent with previous research (Richards & Abbott, 2009). It is also possible that the time-lag adopted in this study (assessments at the start and end of the first year of secondary school) may have influenced the pattern of results.\nFuture work could explore these temporal relationships by including an additional assessment half way through the first year of secondary school and beyond. Future work should also assess academic attainment and psychological functioning prior to entry to secondary school to establish the direction of effects during the transition period with more confidence.",

      "text": "There is great potential for schools to deliver interventions to support pupils with psychological problems. Nevertheless, universal programs based in schools that aim to prevent the development of psychological problems have had only limited success (Spence & Shortt, 2007). The transition to secondary school may represent a window of opportunity for developing and implementing interventions aimed at improving both pupil psychological functioning and attainment. Our findings imply that there are children who are vulnerable to poor academic progression and disengagement during the first year of secondary school. It is also possible that focusing on variables that predict academic progression in school-based programs to support the transition to secondary school could help to integrate mental health services and schooling.  Note. D = depressive symptoms, GA = general anxiety, SA = school anxiety, SC = school concerns, SL = school liking, CP = conduct problems, A = attainment. 1 = baseline assessment at year 7 entry (mean age 11.25), 2 = follow-up assessment at year 7 end (mean age 11.78). Correlations in bold are significant at p<.05. ",
