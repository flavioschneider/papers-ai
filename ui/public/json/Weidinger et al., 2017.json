      "text": "Background. It is often argued that the negative development of intrinsic motivation in elementary school strongly depends on the presence of school grades because grades represent extrinsic consequences and achievement feedback that are supposed to influence intrinsically motivated behaviour. However, only a few studies have tested this hypothesis.\nAims. Therefore, we investigated the role of school grades in inter-and intra-individual changes in elementary school students' intrinsic motivation from when grades were first introduced until the end of elementary school, when students in Germany receive recommendations for a secondary school type on the basis of their prior performance in school.\nSample. A sample of 542 German elementary school students (t 1 : M = 7.95 years, SD = 0.57) was followed for 2 years from the end of Grade 2 to the end of Grade 4.\nMethods. At seven measurement occasions, children's math grades and their domainspecific intrinsic motivation were assessed.\nResults. Latent growth curve models showed differences in trajectories of intrinsic motivation across students rather than uniform development. Moreover, students' trajectories of grades and intrinsic motivation were only weakly associated. A latent cross-lagged model revealed that reciprocal effects between the two constructs over time were small at best. Conclusions. Contrary to theoretical considerations, our results indicate that negative performance feedback in the form of grades does not necessarily lead to a decrease in intrinsic motivation. This calls into question the common opinion that a perception of being less competent, as reflected by poor grades, is responsible for weakening students' intrinsic motivation.\nStudents' school-related intrinsic motivation is commonly regarded as a main determinant of academic achievement, engagement, and school functioning in general (e.g., Corpus & Wormington, 2014;Wigfield et al., 2015). Examining intrinsic motivation (IM) as early as in elementary school is important because IM in the early school years may have farreaching consequences for initial and future school success (e.g., Gottfried, 1990;Musu-Gillette, Wigfield, Harring, & Eccles, 2015). Research on the development of students' a The first two authors contributed equally. *Correspondence should be addressed to Anne F. Weidinger, Emil-Figge-Stra\u00dfe 50, Dortmund, Germany (email: anne. weidinger@tu-dortmund.de).\nschool-related IM has consistently documented that, although very positive at the beginning of elementary school, IM quickly begins to decline and continues to do so until the end of compulsory education (e.g., Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles & Wigfield, 2002;Spinath & Steinmayr, 2012). Therefore, researchers as well as educators are interested in the underlying mechanisms that lead to the weakening of learning-related motivation in order to find ways to support or reactivate the initially high motivation for learning that is found in children at the beginning of their school trajectories.\nA great variety of reasons have been discussed when it comes to explaining the observed decline (for an overview, see Wigfield et al., 2015). It is often argued that the negative development of IM in elementary school strongly depends on the presence of school grades (e.g., Deutsch, 1979) as grades represent extrinsic consequences (see self-determination theory; Ryan & Deci, 2000) and previous achievement outcomes (see expectancy-value model; ) that should influence intrinsically motivated behaviour. Indeed, a large body of research has steadily documented relations between IM and grades (e.g., Corpus, McClintic-Gilbert, & Hayenga, 2009;Gottfried, 1990). To clarify the role of grades for change in students' IM, however, longitudinal studies are needed. Moreover, it is crucial to assess the constructs several times a year (see Viljaranta, Tolvanen, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2014). First, children receive grades not only at the end but also throughout the school year, and the relation between grades and IM could vary within a school year. Second, because of changes in the school environment throughout a student's school career, it is likely that the importance of gradesand thus their relation to IMvaries across school years. More precisely, grades should be of great relevance right after their implementation (usually at the end of Grade 2 in German schools). Furthermore, in tracked academic school systems, grades are especially important at the end of elementary school when students receive recommendations for a specific secondary school type on the basis of their prior performance in school. Investigating children in the period when grades are highly salient is thus a promising approach for broadening knowledge about the developmental dynamics of grades and IM.\nWe are aware of one longitudinal study in which elementary school students' IM and grades were assessed more than twice a year, and the reciprocal relation between them was investigated. However, Weidinger, Spinath, and Steinmayr (2015) found only minor effects of grades on change in students' IM in the domain of German. It remains an open question whether they found only weak relations because they did not consider grades immediately after their implementation. Moreover, the findings should be cross-validated in other domains. Therefore, we investigated whether and how changes in students' IM are related to students' grades in math right after grades are implemented in elementary school.",

      "text": "IM is defined as intrinsic task value according to the expectancy-value model . Accordingly, an activity has high intrinsic value and, thus, is understood as intrinsically motivated when it is performed for no sake but its own reward, and the activity is accompanied by positive emotions and is perceived as highly satisfying (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992). Even though intrinsic task values are not the only reason for learning, affective liking and enjoyment can be considered to be the most desirable states for learners because learning happens as a side effect of engaging in a pleasurable activity (see White, 1959). Research has found that children's intrinsic task values are domainspecific even in the first grade (e.g., Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993). In particular, for elementary school-aged children, intrinsic task values play an outstanding role as these children do not yet distinguish other task values such as utility or importance (e.g., Eccles et al., 1993;Wigfield & Eccles, 1992).\nAt the beginning of elementary school, students' IM is usually very high, but it declines over the school years (e.g., Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001;Jacobs et al., 2002;Spinath & Spinath, 2005;Wigfield et al., 1997). Previous studies on the development of IM in the verbal and math domain in elementary school found a linear motivational decline (Aunola, Leskinen, & Nurmi, 2006;McElvany, Kortenbruck, & Becker, 2008). The question of why students lose their IM for school-related activities has yet to be satisfactorily addressed in empirical research. With regard to suppositions made by motivation theories, we investigated whether and how the onset of grades and their trajectories in elementary school are associated with changes in IM.\nWhy and how are grades supposed to affect intrinsic motivation? Researchers have postulated that an increasingly extrinsic and controlling school atmosphere, an increase in achievement pressure and competition between students, and a progressive negative effect of extrinsic consequences on IM contribute to the decline in IM with age (e.g., Gottfried et al., 2001;Harter, 1981;Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006). School grades, 'the basic currency of our educational system' (Deutsch, 1979, p. 393), might play a decisive role in this development. Because of their symbolic value, grades represent performance feedback and enable a direct social comparison between children (see Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989).\nRegarding the potential impact of grades on students' IM, the cognitive evaluation theory (CET; Deci & Ryan, 1985;Ryan & Deci, 2000) provides a useful framework. This subtheory within self-determination theory posits that IM in achievement settings depends on the fulfilment of two primary needs: the need for competence and the need for autonomy. According to CET, external incentives (e.g., tangible rewards, pressured evaluations, directives) undermine IM because individuals perceive their behaviour as externally regulated instead of self-determined (undermining effect; Deci & Ryan, 1985). However, experimental studies have shown that this undermining effect does not occur when the external incentive comprises positive competence feedback (for an overview, see Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999). It was argued that if the informative aspect of the positive feedback outweighed the controlling aspect of the external incentive, IM should not diminish because the positive competence feedback should satisfy the person's need for competence (see Deci & Ryan, 1985). Applying these considerations to the educational context, school grades can be seen as an external incentive (Deutsch, 1979) that comprises competence-related information. Students with good grades receive positive performance feedback, which should satisfy their need for competence so that they should not lose their IM. By contrast, students with poor grades receive negative performance feedback, which should undermine feelings of competence and therefore lead to a decrease in IM. Vice versa, it is also plausible that IM influences later achievement, for example, mediated via task choice .\nSome studies on older students found at least small effects of grades on changes in IM and of IM on changes in grades (Guay, Ratelle, Roy, & Litalien, 2010;Marsh, Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2005;Wang, 2012). Moreover, the effect of students' first report card grades in secondary school on changes in students' school engagement was mediated via their affective reactions to their grades (Poorthuis et al., 2015). Although effects on IM were not tested, negative affect elicited by poor grades should be incompatible with IM as IM is characterized by positive feelings during task processing (White, 1959). We are aware of only two studies that longitudinally investigated the reciprocal relation between school grades and IM in elementary school while controlling for prior grades and motivation. Using a series of hierarchical regressions, Corpus et al. (2009) found small reciprocal effects between grades and school-related IM over 1 school year in six cohorts (third to eighth grade), whereby analyses were not performed separately for each cohort. Thus, no specific conclusions can be drawn for elementary school children. Weidinger et al. (2015) found only minor effects of students' grades in German on changes in domain-specific IM, whereby both constructs were assessed six times at an interval of 4 months between Grades 3 and 4. The effects might have been somewhat stronger if the constructs had been assessed at the end of Grade 2 when the children received grades for the first time in their school career. If there is an effect of grades on IM, the chances of finding such an effect in this period of education are very high due to the pronounced importance of grades. Moreover, it is necessary to cross-validate findings in another domain. These limitations should be addressed in this study.",

      "text": "Theory suggests that grades have an impact on IM and, accordingly, are responsible for the often-found motivational decline in elementary school. We are not aware of any longitudinal study that investigated the impact of grades on change in IM in elementary school immediately after the onset of grades. To fill this gap and expand knowledge on the determinants of school-related IM, we investigated children's math grades and their domain-specific IM from Grade 2 to Grade 4. Data stem from the same project as the data analysed in the study by Weidinger et al. (2015). However, we focused on another domain, namely math, and on a larger time period that included the second grade. Given the above-mentioned theoretical considerations, this is a useful and necessary extension. The following hypotheses were addressed:\nHypothesis 1: On average, students' IM in math will show a linear decline from the end of Grade 2 to the end of Grade 4 (1a), and there will be significant interindividual differences in the decline over the investigated time period (1b).\nHypothesis 2: The change in students' math grades will be related to the change in students' IM in math: students whose grades deteriorate will show a steeper decline in IM over the investigated time period.\nHypothesis 3: The relation between math grades and IM in math will be reciprocal, so that grades will predict changes in IM (3a), and IM will predict changes in grades (3b).\nTheoretical considerations point to a reciprocal relation, whereas previous findings call it into question (Weidinger et al., 2015).\nBecause children receive grades not only at the end but also throughout the school year, effects might be masked or misinterpreted when grades and IM are assessed only at the beginning and at the end of a school year (Corpus et al., 2009). Therefore, we explored whether the effects would vary according to the frequency of the assessment of the construct within a school year (i.e., the time interval between measurements).",

Grades in elementary school rely heavily on performance on written tests, which are taken several times during the school year, but the quality of oral participation in class is also considered. The math grades considered in our analyses thus represented an average measure of students' preceding performance (see Niepel, Brunner, & Preckel, 2014), and they were based on the grades that the students receivedduringtheschoolyear.Previousstudiesshowedthatstudentsarewellawareoftheir math grades (Dickh\u20ac auser & Plenter, 2005) and that even in elementary school correlations between actual math grades and those reported by the students are strong (Schneider & Sparfeldt, 2016).

      "text": "As is common in longitudinal studies, the current investigation had to deal with missing data related to attrition and non-response (see Little, 2013). Missing data related to attrition occurred when children missed one or more measurement occasions, mainly because of illness. Missing data resulting from non-response occurred at each measurement occasion and ranged from 0.0% (t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 ) to 0.6% (t 4 ) for intrinsic motivation and from 0.2% (t 5 ) to 11.5% (t 1 ) for grades. Complete data sets for all seven measurement occasions were available for 264 students (48.7%), whereas 490 students (90.1%) participated in at least five measurement occasions. Table 1 contains the number of students participating at each measurement. To maximize the power of the analyses, we accounted for missing data by applying full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimations (Graham & Coffman, 2012;Little, 2013). To make the assumption of missingat-random more plausible, we considered a set of variables as missing data correlates (i.e., the teacher ratings of children's math ability) in addition to the analysis variables (Graham, 2003; AUXILIARY option in Mplus, Asparouhov & Muth en, 2008). Further information on the auxiliary variables, which are not of substantive interest here, can be requested from the corresponding author.\nLongitudinal confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) modelling In a preliminary analysis, we tested whether strong factorial invariance of IM measures over time was given (i.e., time-invariant factor loadings and intercepts, Meredith, 1993). Therefore, we estimated a longitudinal CFA model with IM indicated by three items at each of the seven measurement occasions. The residual variances among the corresponding indicators were allowed to correlate over time, and the effects coded method of identification was used for scale setting (Little, 2013). To evaluate invariance constraints, we calculated the change in CFI (\u0394CFI) as here the scaled chi-square (v\u00b2) difference test is too sensitive to trivial differences (Little, 2013). Following guidelines, the supposition of invariance is tenable if \u0394CFI \u2264 .01 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).\nTo estimate latent means and standard deviations of IM as well as the latent correlations between IM and grades across time, grades from t 1 to t 7 were included as manifest variables in the longitudinal CFA model. Phantom constructs were used to transform covariance information into estimates of the latent standard deviations of IM (Little, 2013).",

This method allowed us to describe an overall pattern of change in the construct of interest over time and individual differences in these trajectories (Duncan & Duncan, 2004). First, two linear LGCMs (for IM and grades) were estimated. IM was considered as first-order factor from t 1 to t 7 indicated by three items each time (see CFA model). The latent intercept and slope were modelled as second-order factors. To model a change, the loadings of the first-order factors on the intercept were set to 1. The slope factor loadings from t 1 to t 7 (c t1 -c t7 ) were fixed to [0 1 2 3 4 5 6] to estimate a linear development. Thus, the mean of the slope factor and its algebraic sign indicate the overall magnitude of the change and its direction, whereas the slope variance indicates interindividual differences in change (Hypothesis 1). We used the same approach to model change in math grades, except that grades were included as manifest variable at each time point and the growth factors were first-order factors.\nSecond, the two LGCMs were combined in a bivariate LGCM, and the correlations between the latent intercept and slope factors were estimated. Thus, it was possible to examine the co-occurrence of age-related changes in grades and IM (Hypothesis 2).",

      "text": "Consistent with the literature, our analyses showed a significant linear decrease in mathrelated IM (e.g., Aunola et al., 2006;Spinath & Spinath, 2005;Wigfield et al., 1997). There were also significant differences in trajectories across students, suggesting that the downward trend in IM was more pronounced for some children and less so for others (see Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008). The finding that the development of students' math grades was only weakly related to the decline in students' IM is in line with what was found for the domain of German in elementary school (Weidinger et al., 2015). That we replicated prior findings in another domain even when considering the constructs right after the  implementation of grades is especially remarkable and extends extant research. However, the finding contradicts the supposition that extrinsic consequences and performance feedback in the form of grades undermine intrinsically motivated behaviour (see Deci & Ryan, 1985;.  An explanation for the weak association between change in grades and change in IM could be that, on average, there was only weak change in grades over time and only weak interindividual differences in change. One explanation for the relatively stable mean levels of grades might be that gradingat least to some extantis carried out in reference to normative criteria (grading on the curve; e.g., Guskey, 2000). If this result can be replicated in samples from other countries as well, it will be even more unlikely that changes in grades are a source of changes in IM. One might argue that even if it is not the change in grades that affects children's IM, it is still possible that unchanging poor grades are detrimental for IM. However, the latter is unlikely considering the weak concurrent relations between IM and grades found in the present study.\nThe results from the cross-lagged models also indicate that effects of grades on change in children's math-related IM are, if existent at all, very small in size. Again, our results mirror the findings from the domain of German (Weidinger et al., 2015). Moreover, our results match findings from studies that investigated effects of teachers' ratings of children's performance (Skaalvik & Valas, 1999;Viljaranta et al., 2014) and standardized test performance (Garon-Carrier et al., 2016) on children's IM in math, as these studies also found no substantial effects at the end of elementary school. It is not only the high relative stabilities of grades and IM that account for our results as studies with comparable construct stabilities found at least small effects of prior achievement on the later IM of older children (i.e., from the end of elementary school onwards; e.g., Corpus et al., 2009;Pinxten, Marsh, De Fraine, Van Den Noortgate, & Van Damme, 2014). Furthermore, influences linking IM and performance before the introduction of grades (e.g., teachers' feedback) can also widely be ruled out because grades and IM were only slightly associated at t 1 .\nHowever, the present findings on effects of grades contradict those for secondary school students (e.g., Marsh et al., 2005;Poorthuis et al., 2015). Maybe performance feedback in the form of grades becomes more important for students' motivation after elementary school because self-worth and self-perceptions are shaped more by normative factors (social comparisons) in adolescence than in childhood (see Harter, 1998;Jacobs, Bleeker, & Constantino, 2003) and because of the changes in the school environment that occur in secondary school (see Wigfield & Eccles, 1994). For example, public evaluations of achievement increase in secondary school (Harter, Whitesell, & Kowalski, 1992), which facilitates social achievement comparisons and competition between students (see Wigfield & Eccles, 1994), which in turn should increase the salience of grades and their effects on motivation. In line with this, Poorthuis et al. (2015) found that students who expected their classmates to perform very well (high-performance norms) experienced relatively high levels of negative affect when receiving poor grades. Thus, students' reactions to grades seem to depend at least in part on the perceived importance of their own performance as the perceived importance of performance should be positively associated with higher performance pressure and increased social comparisons. This is in line with the two small effects found in our study. Grades slightly impacted change in IM in math after grades were introduced at the end of Grade 2 and after the recommendations for the school transition in Grade 4 were made. When grades become extremely salient, they seem to have at least a small impact on students' math-related IM even in elementary school. This differentiated picture of the relation between the constructs would not have come to light whether the constructs had been assessed only once a year. Thus, we recommend that researchers investigate change in IM several times during the school year to better understand what impacts this change.\nAlso contrary to studies on older students (Marsh et al., 2005;Steinmayr & Spinath, 2009;Wang, 2012) but in line with results from the German domain in elementary school (Weidinger et al., 2015), we did not find substantial effects of prior IM on later grades in math. In spite of its overall decline, IM remained relatively high at all time points, whereas math-related IM is typically not that positive in secondary school (e.g., Spinath & Steinmayr, 2012). Perhaps a ceiling effect took place, meaning that IM had no further effects on grades.\nOn the basis of our results, we can legitimately conclude that grades seem to play only a minor role in the decline in students' math-related IM in elementary school. When we found an effect, it was only in phases when grades were extremely salient (i.e., after being introduced and after the recommendation for subsequent schools had been made). Therefore, the decline in IM might be attributed to other possibly causative factors. Previous studies showed that parents' perceptions of their child's ability (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002) and parents' motivational practices (i.e., task-intrinsic practices; Gottfried, Marcoulides, Gottfried, & Oliver, 2009) contributed to within-person changes in students' IM. Further potential moderators are factors that proved to be important for IM development such as students' achievement goals (Haimovitz, Wormington, & Corpus, 2011), the teacher-student relationship (Opdenakker, Maulana, & den Brok, 2012), classroom values, teacher enthusiasm (Frenzel, Goetz, Pekrun, & Watt, 2010), and verbal feedback during class (Jurik, Gr\u20ac oschner, & Seidel, 2014;Rakoczy, Klieme, B\u20ac urgermeister, & Harks, 2008).",

      "text": "The fact that we considered the longitudinal interplay between IM and grades in an educational phase when grades are highly relevant to students (i.e., right after grades are implemented and when they are used for secondary school recommendations) is particularly suitable for drawing conclusions about the role of grades in change in IM. However, our findings must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, we investigated only students from Germany. In most German federal states, the transition to secondary school takes place after Grade 4. Thus, it is important to evaluate the generalizability of the findings in other countries where children leave elementary school later. Second, we analysed data from the same project as Weidinger et al. (2015). Results should be replicated with other teachers and students. Third, we investigated only one aspect of adaptive motivational orientation in school, namely the enjoyment and pleasure one gains from doing math. Thus, our results are limited to this specific aspect of motivation. Finally, we investigated only grades as one source of achievement-related feedback. However, students are exposed to different kinds of performance feedback in everyday school life. Besides verbal feedback from teachers and peers during class, students receive implicit information on how good their school performance is (e.g., who is offered help or who is asked to answer a difficult question; see Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989). In line with these ideas, even young children seem to be quite good at evaluating their actual performance without receiving explicit feedback (see Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2009). In this context, it would be interesting to see how teachers' judgements of students' ability impact a student's motivational development (see Urhahne, 2015). This is particularly important with regard to intervention programs as teachers could be taught how several behaviours and responses might affect their students' IM.",

      "text": "The fact that results found in the German domain (Weidinger et al., 2015) could be replicated in math in the present study is a further hint that IM is not so much a result of competence feedback from grades than of other factors. Furthermore, our results showed that IM is very high in elementary school and its decline is not as strong as one might expect even in phases that put much pressure on students such as when transition recommendations are made. Finally, it shows that the relation between change in IM and school grades should be investigated within time spans shorter than 1 year because effects might otherwise be overlooked or misinterpreted.\nOur findings have important practical implications for educators and educational and developmental psychologists working in school settings. The finding that grades are only weakly related to the negative development of students' IM is counterintuitive and contradicts the widespread notion that grades, especially poor grades, are detrimental to the pleasure one gains from doing school-related task. It is important to know this because teachers might feel as if they are doing harm when grading their students. The results indicate that students' IM for school-based learning does not necessarily suffer in the face of suboptimal grades.",
