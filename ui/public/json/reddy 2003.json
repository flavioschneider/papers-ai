  "title": "The influence of teacher support on student adjustment in the middle school years: A latent growth curve study",
  "abstract": "The influence of perceived teacher support on trajectories of depression and self-esteem in middle school was examined using multigroup latent growth cross-domain models. A longitudinal sample of 2,585 students was followed from the sixth through the eighth grades. Students' perceptions of teacher support and general self-esteem declined and depressive symptoms increased over the course of middle school. We further found that, for both boys and girls, changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both self-esteem and depression. In particular, those students perceiving increasing teacher support showed corresponding decreases in depressive symptoms and increases in self-esteem. Gender differences were found for the initial levels of both perceptions of teacher support and general self-esteem. A competing model was also tested, which gave additional support for pathways of influence from perceptions of teacher support to depression and self-esteem, rather than the reverse. This study underscores the role of teacher support in facilitating students' adjustment to middle school and highlights the importance of using idiographic methodologies in the study of developmental processes. Implications and future directions are discussed. Middle schools are a crucial developmental times serve as confidants, mentors, and friends (Lynch & Cicchetti, 1992). Despite context, and teachers play an important role in students' adjustment (Roeser, Eccles, & the importance of student-teacher relationships, middle schools are often structured in Sameroff, 1998Sameroff, , 2000.

Because teachers and teacher-reported socioemotional adjustment outcomes (see also Lynch & Cicchetti, have the advantage of standing outside these struggles, they can provide a safe context 1997; Pianta, 1994). Similar patterns have emerged for older students. For example, in for support and guidance while transmitting their work on school reform, Midgley and iors that are more typical of girls (Wentzel, 1991).

Consistent with previous research on this topic, we rely on perceptions of teacher for emotional distress (Hansen, Walker, & Flom, 1995). Other researchers have noted support rather than presumably more objective reports of support. This approach is teachers' preferences for the cooperative, responsible, and nonassertive classroom behav-theoretically grounded in the attachment and social support literature, which has shown that esteem and decreased depressive symptoms.\nSimilarly, perceptions of decreased teacher perceptions of support availability are more consistently related to outcomes than support were expected to correspond with decreased self-esteem and increased depressive are the levels of support that are actually received (Kessler & McLeod, 1984;Lakey & symptoms. We also anticipated that gender would moderate the differences in the effects Cohen, 2000). From this perspective, it is not support experiences themselves, but the of perceived teacher support on self-esteem and depression.

Also, in keeping with previous studies (e.g., Well-being was indexed by depressive symptoms and general self-esteem, each of which Goodenow, 1993;Hughes et al., 2001;Wentzel, 1997Wentzel, , 1998 has shown associations with overall support (Harter & Marold, 1994) and teacher support and the middle school practice of moving from class to class each period, we assessed . adolescents' perceptions of the teachers in their schools as opposed to one particular Method teacher.\nTo date, statistical techniques to under-Our data were drawn from a larger ongoing longitudinal evaluation of early adoles-stand the nature of perceived teacher support and its impact on adolescent developmental cents in middle schools.
