  "title": "Enjoying mathematics or feeling competent in mathematics? Reciprocal effects on mathematics achievement and perceived math effort expenditure",
  "abstract": "Background. The multidimensionality of the academic self-concept in terms of domain specificity has been well established in previous studies, whereas its multidimensionality in terms of motivational functions (the so-called affect-competence separation) needs further examination. Aim. This study aims at exploring differential effects of enjoyment and competence beliefs on two external validity criteria in the field of mathematics. Sample. Data analysed in this study were part of a large-scale longitudinal research project. Following a five-wave design, math enjoyment, math competence beliefs, math achievement, and perceived math effort expenditure measures were repeatedly collected from a cohort of 4,724 pupils in Grades 3-7. Method. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the internal factor structure of the math self-concept. Additionally, a series of nested models was tested using structural equation modelling to examine longitudinal reciprocal interrelations between math competence beliefs and math enjoyment on the one hand and math achievement and perceived math effort expenditure on the other.",

      "text": "This study provides further support for the affect-competence separation. Theoretical issues regarding adequate conceptualization and practical consequences for practitioners are discussed.\nIn educational research, academic self-concept has received considerable attention and it is widely accepted as both an important predictor for a wide range of academic outcomes (i.e., achievement and coursework selection) and a desirable outcome in itself (Craven & Marsh, 2008). In contrast with this, research linking emotions and achievement mostly narrows down to negative associations between anxiety and educational outcomes (Valiente, Swanson, & Eisenberg, 2012). Moreover, research on the role of positive emotions in academic achievement is scant. Until recently, empirical research on academic self-concept on the one hand and academic emotions on the other often has been considered as separate lines of research within the field of educational psychology (Goetz, Cronjaeger, Frenzel, L\u20ac udtke, & Hall, 2010).\nThe present study aims at bringing both lines together by empirically investigating the nature of the interrelations between math enjoyment and math competence beliefs on the one hand and math achievement and perceived math effort expenditure on the other. On the basis of a longitudinal research design with multiple measures throughout primary education, reciprocal linkages between these variables will be explored.",

      "text": "From a historical perspective, academic self-concept research could be easily described as a rich and well-established research area wherein considerable attention is given to its internal multidimensional structure in terms of domain specificity (e.g., Brunner et al., 2010;Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976;Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990). Academic self-concept is generally conceptualized as students' beliefs of their own domain-specific and/or global academic capabilities. In evaluating one's academic capacities, inevitably, both rational/cognitive and emotional/affective reactions come into play. Bong and Skaalvik (2003) distinguish at the conceptual level between two different views regarding the role of these affective reactions: affective responses as (1) part of the academic self-concept; or (2) as distinct constructs (i.e., expectancy-value theory perspective [EVT]). Academic self-concept researchers endorsing the former point of view generally consider affective responses and competence beliefs as distinguishable but highly related components of academic self-concept (Bong & Clark, 1999). More specifically, these affective emotions are labelled as an important aspect of the academic self-concept that even needs to be integrated in its construct definition (Bong & Skaalvik, 2003). Illustratively, in the different versions of the widely used Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ I, Marsh, 1992;SDQ II, Marsh, 1999), items such as 'I look forward to (a subject)' are added to the academic self-concept assessment. By contrast, from an EVT perspective (e.g., Eccles, 2005), clear conceptual distinctions are being made between competence perceptions (i.e., academic self-concept) and affective responses (i.e., intrinsic valueenjoyment; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000, p. 72). However, we would like to emphasize that there is no clear-cut distinction between both perspectives because even among academic self-concept researchers, there are ambivalent positions as to whether affective measures should be included. In conclusion, there is no consensus in the field that affective responses are conceptually part of the academic self-concept. Hence, there is a clear need for empirical studies attempting to shed light on the conceptual role of affective emotions.\nTo resolve this issue, several researchers empirically examined this, so-called, affect-competence distinction of academic self-concept (e.g., Arens, Yeung, Craven, & Hasselhorn, 2011;Marsh & Ayotte, 2003). All studies that explicitly investigated the affect-competence separation of academic self-concept used the SDQ I or SDQ II to assess academic self-concept. With the exception of three items assessing students' interest in the mathematical, verbal, and general school domain in the SDQ I, all affective items in the SDQ I and SDQ II refer to the positive emotion enjoyment. Because the measurement of affect in these instruments primarily narrows down to enjoyment, we will therefore specify affect as enjoyment throughout the remainder of this study. Marsh, Craven, and Debus (1999) argue in favour of both an internal and an external network approach when investigating the separation between competence beliefs (i.e., perceiving oneself as competent in a particular domain) and enjoyment (i.e., liking schoolwork in a particular domain). Whereas the first approach refers to the internal factor structure of academic self-concept, the latter concerns the investigation of differential relations with external validity criteria (educational outcomes). Based on the EVT premises, Arens et al. (2011) argue that both components yield different motivational characteristics. It is believed that competence beliefs primarily influence immediate outcomes such as actual performance on a test, whereas enjoyment is more strongly related to long-term educational choice outcomes such as subject enrolment and future aspirations.",

      "text": "Several studies examined the internal factor structure of academic self-concept in various domains (e.g., Arens et al., 2011;Marsh & Ayotte, 2003;Yeung, 2011). To test the enjoyment-competence separation, the model fit of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models wherein both components were considered as common indicators of academic self-concept was compared with models wherein both components were modelled as separate latent constructs. Arens et al. (2011) investigated this two-dimensional structure of academic self-concept in terms of motivational functions within three specific domains (math, language, and general school), and the authors found significant improvements in model fit when competence beliefs and enjoyment items were loaded on separate factors. Both factors were highly correlated within each domain: general school r = .73, math r = .81, and language r = .78 (similar correlations were reported by Marsh & Ayotte, 2003). By contrast, Goetz et al. (2010) found stronger correlations in quantitative domains (physics and math) than those in verbal domains. According to the authors, these larger correlations could be ascribed to the fact that the 'quantitative domains are more narrowly defined and have a more restricted range of class-room activities than do language domains' (p. 52). From a cross-cultural comparison perspective, domain-specific correlations among competence beliefs and enjoyment showed to be systematically higher in Arab countries than those in Anglo-Saxon countries (Marsh et al., 2012). Finally, Marsh et al. (1999) indicated that the enjoyment-competence separation is less pronounced for younger pupils in Grades 2 and 3.",

      "text": "A necessary condition for separating competence beliefs and enjoyment is their differential relation with external outcome criteria. To date, only three external validity criteria have been explicitly investigated within the framework of the enjoymentcompetence distinction of academic self-concept: academic achievement, effort expenditure, and educational aspirations (i.e., wanting to take more coursework in a particular domain).\nSeveral studies showed that within-domain correlations between competence beliefs and achievement were substantially larger than the correlations between enjoyment and achievement (Arens et al., 2011;Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, & Pekrun, 2008;Marsh et al., 2012;Shen & Tam, 2008). For example, for competence beliefs, correlations of .61 and .63 with achievement in the math and verbal domain, respectively, were observed, whereas for enjoyment, correlations of .37 and .33 with achievement in the math and verbal domain, respectively, were found (Arens et al., 2011). Thus, perceiving oneself as competent in a particular domain is more strongly related to actual performance than enjoying schoolwork in that particular domain. In contrast, Marsh et al. (2012) found that correlations between enjoyment and educational aspirations were substantially higher than the correlations between perceived competence and educational aspirations. For example, in the math domain, the authors observed correlations ranging from .27 to .49 for math competence beliefs, whereas for math enjoyment, correlations ranging from .49 to .70 were found. Apparently, liking math is more strongly related to taking more math courses than perceived competence in math. Nagengast et al. (2011) reached a similar conclusion regarding career aspirations in science. Finally, Yeung (2011) found that enjoyment was somewhat more correlated with school effort expenditure than competence beliefs. However, only relations between both variables in the general school domain were examined.\nIt should be noted that previously reported relations between enjoyment, competence beliefs, and external outcomes are merely cross-sectional/correlational in nature. Although informative, it is hard to pronounce upon 'cause' and 'effect' without a longitudinal measurement design (preferably with adequate control for prior measures). Therefore, in the next paragraph, we will focus on previous research that explicitly focused on the longitudinal interrelations between the variables at stake.",

      "heading": "Longitudinal/reciprocal linkages between competence beliefs, enjoyment, and educational outcomes",
      "text": "The reciprocal relation between competence beliefs in the academic domain and academic achievement has been well established (Marsh & Martin, 2011). A wide range of studies found evidence for the central premises of the reciprocal effects model (REM) implying that prior competence beliefs have a positive effect on later achievement and that prior achievement increases subsequent competence beliefs (e.g., Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003;Marsh, Hau, & Kong, 2002;Marsh & O'Mara, 2008;Marsh, Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2005;M\u20ac oller, Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2011;Pinxten, De Fraine, Van Damme, & D'Haenens, 2010). Results from several meta-analyses showed no gender differences in this reciprocal relation (Huang, 2011;Valentine, Dubois, & Cooper, 2004). As advised by Skaalvik and Valas (1999), the large majority of these studies primarily included cognitive competence measures and, consequently, did not differentiate between competence beliefs and more affective items.\nUntil recently, the role of positive emotions, such as academic enjoyment, in learning and achievement has long been neglected in educational research (Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002;Valiente et al., 2012). However, stimulated by the advent of the positive psychology movement (e.g., Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000), more longitudinal research exploring this relationship emerged. For example, Goetz et al. (2008) found evidence for the mediational role of competence beliefs in the relation between prior achievement and subsequent enjoyment. Achievement had a positive within-domain effect on students' competence beliefs, which, in turn, was positively related to enjoyment in the same domain, and this relation was shown to be similar for boys and girls (Frenzel, Pekrun, & Goetz, 2007a). Interestingly, direct effects of math achievement on math enjoyment turned out negative when math competence beliefs were included into their models. Positively activating emotions are assumed to influence achievement positively through increased motivation and enhanced flexible learning strategies (Pekrun et al., 2002). As such, the authors presume a reciprocal feedback loop wherein '\u2026 emotions affect students' achievement, but feedback of achievement and related experiences of success and failure can in turn influence students' emotions\u2026' (p. 102). However, to date, research examining long-term reciprocal interrelations between positively activating emotions and competence beliefs on the one hand and academic achievement on the other is largely lacking.\nIn the motivational research literature, academic effort expenditure has been frequently investigated in relation to students' goal orientations and causal attributions of success and failure (e.g., Covington, 2000;Dweck, 2006;Robins & Pals, 2002). For example, a mastery goal orientation (i.e., an engagement primarily aimed at improving levels of competence and understanding) has been linked with maintained effort expenditure. Although one could argue that an emphasis on academic effort is advantageous in improving performance given its internal/controllable nature (Yeung, 2011), empirical research focusing on antecedents and consequences of academic effort expenditure as an educational outcome on its own is rather scarce.\nRegarding academic enjoyment, apparently no study investigated the predictive power of enjoying a particular subject on the exerted effort in that subject. Pekrun et al. (2002) reported a strong positive relation between academic enjoyment and effort exerted in schoolwork on the basis of cross-sectional data. However, failing to control for other variables in the equation results in a high degree of distortion. In contrast, several studies reported positive effects of perceived math competence on later effort exerted in math (Chouinard, Karsenti, & Roy, 2007;Greene, DeBacker, Ravindran, & Krows, 1999;Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, Roberts, Schnyder, & Niggli, 2009). In general, students who perceive themselves as competent about their own academic capacities and who are confident about achieving learning objectives are generally willing to invest more effort in their academic work (Levpu s cek, Zupan ci c, & So can, 2012). Interestingly, Trautwein et al. (2009) found evidence for the mediational role of effort expenditure in the relation between prior competence beliefs and later achievement even after controlling for prior achievement.\nIt should be noted that all studies reported above focused on perceived rather than actual effort expenditure. Additionally, all these studies considered samples of secondary school students. This implies that students had already made some choices regarding the composition of their curriculum (e.g., with less or more math/science subjects). The deliberate decision to choose a particular study programme (i.e., curriculum) in secondary education logically explains the positive association found above. However, one might argue that in primary education (with a compulsory curriculum for all pupils), higher competence beliefs are linked with decreased academic effort exerted because these pupils already feel competent/confident for doing well in that particular subject.",

Second, instead of a single external criterion, both math achievement and perceived math effort expenditure will serve as outcome variables when examining differential effects of math enjoyment and math competence beliefs. Third, as stated above, to date, antecedents of perceived effort expenditure have been mostly explored in secondary school.

One of its main goals was to gain insight into the educational trajectories of an original sample of approximately 6,000 pupils throughout the course of primary education. Achievement data were collected at the end of each grade (Grades 1-7), whereas questionnaires assessing academic self-concept and perceived effort expenditure were only administered from Grade 4 onward (Grades 4-7). Given the longitudinal research interest in this study, both pupils from the original sample and pupils who enrolled at a later time point were selected on condition that they had at least two measures available on each of the three core variables (math self-concept, perceived math effort expenditure, and math achievement), resulting in a final sample of 4,724 pupils. Of these 4,724 pupils, 3,638 pupils (77%) were part of the original SiBO sample and 1,086 pupils (23%) enrolled at a later point in time in the project. Thus, we focused on a subsample of 4,724 pupils when they were in Grades 3-7 (49.5% boys and 50.5% girls).

From these six items, three items referred to pupils' competence beliefs in math (i.e., I learn things quickly in mathematics; I get good marks in mathematics; I'm good at mathematics), whereas the other three items assessed math enjoyment (i.e., I like mathematics; I enjoy doing work in mathematics; I look forward to mathematics).

For purposes of model comparison between complex models and more parsimonious models, the following rough guidelines were employed in the present paper. A decrease in fit of the more parsimonious model of <.01 in CFI (Chen, 2007;Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) and an increase of <.015 in RMSEA (Chen, 2007;Chen, Curran, Bollen, Kirby, & Paxton, 2008) provided support for the more parsimonious model.

In contrast, the second model, with math enjoyment and math competence beliefs as separate latent constructs, showed a close fit to the data. In line with our expectations, models with correlated error terms included showed an improved fit over models without it (Model 2 vs. Model 1). An inspection of the factor loadings of the latter model showed that both constructs were well defined over all grades, although it should be noted that both components were highly correlated (.72, .69, .66., and .60 in Grades 4-7, respectively; see Table 3). However, no correlations close to 1 were observed, so we could legitimately conclude that the affect and competence beliefs component of math self-concept are separable constructs. Correlations between perceptions of math competence and math enjoyment became slightly smaller with increasing age.\nBetween-network relations: Math achievement Both math enjoyment and math competence beliefs were positively related to math achievement (Table 3). It should be noted that cross-sectional correlations between math competence beliefs and math achievement (.47-.60) were in general about twice as large as the correlations between math enjoyment and math achievement (.17-.29).    To test the longitudinal causal relation between the variables at stake, three models were tested successively (Models 3-6). In all presented models, high stability path coefficients were observed for math achievement (ranging between .61 and .83). These high stability paths indicate large proportions of explained variance and, as a consequence, leave little room for other variables to significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent math achievement.\nModel 3 (see Figure 1) did not fit the data accurately (see Table 4). In contrast, both Model 4a (reciprocal relation between math enjoyment and math achievement) and Model 4b (reciprocal relation between math competence beliefs and math achievement) showed a good fit to the data. Although effect sizes were larger for math competence beliefs than for math enjoyment, both Models 4a and 4b provided support for the REM (see Figure 2). Enjoying math positively predicted later math achievement, and math achievement had a positive effect on subsequent math enjoyment (except for the last waves). For math competence beliefs, a full REM was supported: In all waves, prior math competence beliefs had a positive effect on subsequent math achievement and vice versa. Note. RMSEA = root mean square error of approximation; CFI = Comparative Fit Index; TLI = Tucker -Lewis Index. Model 5 presented a more balanced picture because longitudinal relations between math enjoyment and math competence beliefs were modelled simultaneously. An inspection of the pattern of the structural cross-paths revealed slightly different causal patterns for math enjoyment and math competence beliefs (see Figure 3). Regarding the latter, our results showed a persistent pattern of positive relations between math competence beliefs and math achievement. Additionally, prior math achievement positively predicted subsequent math enjoyment. However, when juxtaposing the results of Model 4a and Model 5, effects of prior math enjoyment on math achievement became slightly negative. Thus, when math competence beliefs were taken into account, the unique component of math enjoyment that cannot be explained in terms of competence beliefs had a small negative effect on achievement. Furthermore, prior math enjoyment positively predicted subsequent math competence beliefs, whereas prior math competence beliefs had no significant influence on subsequent math enjoyment. Separate models for boys and girls revealed only small differences, thus confirming similar structural relationships between math enjoyment, math competence beliefs, and achievement for male and female pupils (Appendix S1).\nBetween-network relations: Perceived math effort expenditure In general, math enjoyment was more strongly correlated with perceived effort (cross-sectional correlations between .21 and .46) than math competence beliefs (correlations between \u00c0.04 and .32; see Table 3). Similar to math achievement, these correlations decreased throughout primary education. Additionally, math achievement was negatively correlated with perceived math effort expenditure: Lower performing students reported spending more time and energy in studying math in comparison with their better achieving peers.\nIn Model 6, no significant effects of prior math self-concept on subsequent perceived effort put into math were observed (see Figure 4). When math enjoyment and math competence beliefs were tested separately, no effect was found of prior math enjoyment on perceived math effort expenditure (Model 7a). Enjoying math did not lead to increased self-reported levels of effort put into math (see Figure 5). A totally different pattern of the structural relations was observed for math competence beliefs (Model 7b). Our results showed support for a consistent pattern of negative relations between prior math competence beliefs and later perceived math effort expenditure implying that pupils who perceived themselves as more competent in math put less effort into math. This pattern was replicated in Model 8 (see Figure 6). By contrast, math enjoyment only had a limited positive effect on subsequent exerted effort in math (math enjoyment at the end of Grade 5 had a small positive effect (.08) on perceived math effort expenditure in Grade 6). Gender-specific models showed that the mild positive effect of prior math enjoyment on later perceived math effort expenditure was mainly pronounced for girls (Appendix S2). All other path coefficients of the structural paths were largely the same for boys and girls suggesting only small gender differences.  Between-network relations: Perceived math effort expenditure and math achievement combined The final Model 9 fits the data closely, and the same structural relations as in the previous models were observed. Additionally, both prior math competence beliefs (standardized path coefficients ranging between \u00c0.09 and \u00c0.12) and prior math achievement (standardized path coefficients ranging between \u00c0.06 and \u00c0.20) negatively predicted perceived math effort expenditure (Appendix S3). Pupils who perform worse in math or who perceive themselves as less competent in it reported putting more effort into math (probably to compensate for their underperformance). Similar to Model 8, prior math enjoyment only had a mild positive effect on subsequent perceived effort expenditure and this was mostly the case for girls.",

      "heading": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study aimed to investigate the two-dimensional separation between affect (enjoyment) and competence beliefs of math self-concept. From a within-network perspective, a  two-dimensional model more adequately reflected the internal factor structure of the math self-concept compared with unidimensional models wherein enjoyment and competence beliefs were included together: Models incorporating this distinction fit the data substantially better than models that did not. A between-network approach, examining differential relationships with educational outcome variables, revealed considerable differences between math enjoyment and math competence beliefs. Going beyond a mere correlational/cross-sectional examination, math competence beliefs had positive longitudinal effects on math achievement and negative effects on subsequent perceived math effort expenditure. The juxtaposition of models with math enjoyment and math competence beliefs combined in a single model, and separate models for both enjoyment and competence beliefs yielded some interesting results. For example, when considered in a separate model, prior math enjoyment had a small but positive effect on subsequent achievement. However, when math competence beliefs were simultaneously controlled for, this positive relation disappeared. This finding is consistent with the findings of Marsh et al. (2005) who observed that previous positive effects of math interest on achievement turned out non-significant when math competence beliefs were included in the model. Thus, given that math competence beliefs and enjoyment are so highly correlated, we conclude that the unique component of math enjoyment that cannot be explained in terms of competence beliefs has a small negative effect on math achievement.\nWe would like to refer back to the conceptual question raised in the introduction of this study: Should enjoyment and competence beliefs still be considered as separate subcomponents under the banner of academic self-concept or should we bring the academic self-concept notion back to its core essence, that is, perceived competence in the academic domain? In line with Arens et al. (2011) and other motivational researchers who suggest that perceived competence and affective reactions (such as enjoyment) may be treated as separate constructs (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 2000), we would like to argue in favour of the latter. Given the strong empirical support for the affect-competence separation of both the present study and previous studies, we recommend that future researchers explicitly differentiate between both constructs and avoid ambivalent positions regarding this distinction. More specifically, rather than talking of affective subcomponents/dimensions of the academic self-concept construct, affective/emotional constructs (such as anxiety and enjoyment) should be treated and conceptualized as full constructs at the same level as the academic self-concept construct.\nIn our opinion, this position does not ignore the high correlation between both constructs nor does it set aside the involvement of emotional/affective responses in the self-evaluation of one's domain-specific competence. In line with Marsh and Ayotte (2003), an interesting question then remains why academic self-concept and enjoyment are so synchronous and whether one of both constructs is causally predominant over the other. The results of the present study enable us to pronounce upon the causal ordering of both constructs. A consistent pattern of positive relations of prior enjoyment to subsequent academic self-concept was observed, whereas no effect of prior academic self-concept on later enjoyment was found. Apparently, positive emotions (such as enjoyment) mediate processes that lead to perceptions of greater competency. In this respect, researchers should explore whether actual effort expenditure, rather than perceived effort expenditure, serves as a mediator between enjoyment/competence beliefs and achievement as it seems reasonable that it relates to achievement via decreased or increased actual effort put into math. Unfortunately, because of the lack of a time lag between predictors (enjoyment/competence beliefs), mediator (effort), and outcome (achievement), we were unable to address this topic within the framework of the present study.\nAlthough beyond the scope of the present study, another important direction for future research is a thorough investigation of the nature of the interaction between enjoyment and academic self-concept in relation to important educational outcomes. Nagengast et al. (2011;also see Trautwein et al., 2012) empirically investigated the latent interaction between academic self-concept (reflecting expectancy) and enjoyment (reflecting value) in an EVT framework. For both the pursuit of extracurricular science-related activities and science career aspirations, the authors found evidence for a significant statistical interaction in a way that the effects of science self-concept on both outcomes became more positive when science enjoyment was high and vice versa. In this respect, an external validity criterion that has not been investigated previously is coursework selection (Arens et al., 2011). For example, do two students who feel equally competent about their mathematical ability make different educational choices based on different levels of math enjoyment? Within this framework, an exploration of interrelations with students' perception of the utility of math (e.g., Watt et al., 2012) would be a valuable contribution to the existing research literature.",

      "heading": "Implications for practice",
      "text": "The results of this study yield important practical implications for primary school teachers. It is important for teachers to acknowledge pupils' declining levels of both math self-concept and math enjoyment throughout the second stage of primary education. The strong positive effects of math self-concept on achievement suggest that enhancing pupils' academic self-concept can have beneficial consequences on their achievement. For example, O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, and Debus (2006) showed that interventions aimed at enhancing academic self-concept are generally effective and that direct (activities designed to improve students' academic self-concept directly) and domain-specific interventions are more effective than indirect (skill building) and general interventions, respectively. Following the premises of the REM, Marsh et al. (2005) already emphasized that teachers should target and enhance academic self-concept and achievement simultaneously to establish sustained learning gains.\nThe question then remains whether it would be beneficial to make math classes more attractive/enjoyable (and thus increasing pupils' enjoyment levels) in order to improve pupils' math performance, academic self-concept, or effort expenditure. Our results show that compared with the rather large positive effects sizes of math self-concept on achievement, there is less gain in improving pupils' achievement directly through increased levels of math enjoyment. However, prior math enjoyment is positively associated with pupils' later math self-concept (which in turn is positively related to subsequent math achievement) and, although to a lesser extent, perceived math effort expenditure. As such, making math more attractive to increase levels of enjoyment can be considered as one of the more indirect strategies to enhance math achievement. For example, a higher judgement of the quality of math instruction by students was linked with increased levels of math enjoyment (Frenzel, Pekrun, & Goetz, 2007b; also see Vandecandelaere, Speybroeck, Vanlaar, De Fraine, & Van Damme, 2012). Altogether, practitioners in the field should be aware of the substantial correlation between math enjoyment and math self-concept.",
