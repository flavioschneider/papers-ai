  "title": "Does self-competence predict gender differences in adolescent depression and anxiety?",
  "abstract": "This longitudinal study examined 75 young adolescents to explore whether selfcompetence predicts the emergence of gender differences in depression and anxiety. During both 6th and 7th grade, boys reported signi\u00aecantly higher levels of selfcompetence than did girls. In addition, boys were signi\u00aecantly less depressed and anxious than girls in 7th grade, but not in 6th grade. Finally, when the variance contributed by self-competence was accounted for, the relationship between gender and trait anxiety weakened and the relationship between gender and depression became non-signi\u00aecant. These results support the hypothesis that self-competence is partially responsible for the emergence of gender differences in depression and anxiety during early adolescence.",

      "text": "A vast literature has demonstrated that the prevalence of emotional problems, particularly depression and anxiety, rises dramatically during adolescence (Compas et al., 1993;Lewinsohn et al., 1994). Therefore, it is not surprising that many adolescents experience symptoms of depression. While the majority of adolescents cannot be diagnosed as being clinically depressed (about 3\u00b19% experience severe depression; Brooks-Gunn and Stewart et al., 1994), many studies have indicated that approximately one-third of adolescents experience mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Compas et al., 1993;Stewart et al., 1994).\nCompared to depression, the examination of adolescent anxiety has been relatively neglected. This is unfortunate since recent research (cf., Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990) has indicated that anxiety may be even more common than depression during adolescence. In addition, similar to depression, it is clear that the experience of anxiety increases during adolescence (Clark et al., 1994;Ebata et al., 1990). Conservative prevalence estimates indicate that about 16% of young adolescents (12-year-olds), 17% of middle adolescents (14\u00b116-year-olds), and 21% of late adolescents (17-year-olds) meet the criteria necessary to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990). Importantly, a larger majority of adolescents experience mild to moderate levels of anxiety which also may negatively affect their development (Ohannessian et al., 1996). problems. It is apparent that both depression and anxiety have implications for immediate and long-term psychosocial functioning. For example, adolescent depression and anxiety have been found to be related to academic problems, social problems, delinquency, substance abuse, and eating disorders during adolescence (Lehman, 1985;Kandel and Davies, 1986;Strauss et al., 1988). Moreover, emotional problems during adolescence (particularly depression) have been found to be signi\u00aecantly associated with adolescent suicide (Simons and Murphy, 1985;Buie and Maltsberger, 1989).\nThe experience of emotional problems during adolescence also has been linked to problems occurring during adulthood. This primarily appears to be due to the fact that emotional problems that emerge during adolescence tend to persist into adulthood (Weissman et al., 1985;Ebata et al., 1990). Therefore, it is not surprising that many adolescents who experience emotional problems are more likely to have psychosocial dif\u00aeculties during adulthood, including marital problems, work-related problems, and substance abuse (Kandel and Davies, 1986).",

      "text": "The implications of emotional problems are especially pertinent to adolescent girls since a wealth of research has demonstrated that they are at a much greater risk for experiencing depression and anxiety than are adolescent boys. In fact, many studies have indicated that adolescent girls are at least twice as likely to develop clinical depression and anxiety disorders in comparison to adolescent boys (Kashani et al., 1989;Cohen et al., 1993). Adolescent girls also have been found to be signi\u00aecantly more likely to experience low and moderate levels of depression and anxiety than adolescent boys (Allgood-Merten et al., 1990;Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990;Ohannessian et al., 1996). Since emotional problems that develop during adolescence tend to persist into adulthood, it is not surprising that this gender difference similarly continues throughout adulthood, with women remaining twice as likely to experience emotional problems than men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990).\nWhen do gender differences emerge? What is most intriguing about the gender difference in emotional problems is that it is absent during childhood (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990;Brooks-Gunn and Petersen, 1991;Cohen et al., 1993). 1 One important question, therefore, is when do these gender differences emerge? Presently, the answer to this question is unclear. Most of the research within this area conducted to date has focused on middleto-late adolescents. Research focusing on these age groups has consistently demonstrated that adolescent girls are more likely to experience depression and anxiety (symptomatology and clinical disorders) than are adolescent boys (cf., Brooks-Gunn, 1991;Petersen et al., 1991;. It is important to note, however, that some studies examining younger adolescents (11\u00b112-year-olds) have found the same pattern of results, indicating that even early adolescent females may be more at-risk for depression and anxiety than early adolescent males (Kandel and Davies, 1986;Ohannessian et al., 1996). These latter studies point to the critical need to assess youngsters as early as late childhood to determine when this gender difference consistently emerges.\nWhy do gender differences emerge? The other question that needs to be addressed is why do gender differences in emotional adjustment occur? What variables predict these differences? Many studies have found adolescent girls and boys to differ on a number of psychosocial variables; in turn, these differences have been hypothesized to be linked to gender differences in adolescent emotional adjustment. For example, research has shown that girls are more likely than are boys to use ruminative coping techniques (Compas et al., 1993;. During early adolescence, girls also have been found to have more negative body images in comparison to boys (Simmons and Blyth, 1987;Allgood-Merten et al., 1990). In turn, ruminative coping and having a negative body image have been linked to depression (Brooks-Gunn, 1988;Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993). Consistent with these \u00aendings, during adolescence, girls with less masculine sex-role behaviors have been found to be more likely to experience depressive symptomatology than girls with more masculine sex-role behaviors (Obeidallah et al., 1994).\nMuch more research has examined the relationship between perceptions of the self and emotional adjustment during adolescence. This research has indicated that adolescent girls have lower levels of self-esteem, self-worth, perceived physical attractiveness, and athletic competence than do adolescent boys (Allgood-Merten et al., 1990;Ohannessian et al., 1996). Positive perceptions of the self, in turn, have been consistently associated with better emotional adjustment, as indicated by lower reported levels of depression and anxiety (Allgood-Merten et al., 1990;Papini and Roggman, 1992).",

      "text": "Although the \u00aendings discussed above are intriguing, it is still unclear whether these psychosocial variables actually predict the emergence of gender differences in emotional adjustment during adolescence. To examine this issue, a number of criteria need to be met. First, longitudinal data are needed. Unfortunately, many of the studies conducted to date have relied on cross-sectional data, and therefore have not been able to examine predictive relationships. Second, using longitudinal data, one needs to demonstrate that there are signi\u00aecant gender differences in depression and/or anxiety during adolescence. Third, the predictor variable being examined (e.g. perceptions of the self ) must be shown to be signi\u00aecantly associated with the dependent variable(s) (depression or anxiety). Finally, gender differences in the predictor variable must be shown to occur prior to gender differences in the dependent variable(s) (see Nolen-Hoeksema and Girgus, 1994, for a more detailed discussion of these criteria). If all of these criteria are met, the predictor variable may be said to at least partially account for gender differences in the dependent variable being assessed.\nA study conducted by Allgood-Merten et al. (1990) met all of these criteria but one. Allgood-Merten et al. (1990) were unable to test whether gender differences in the predictor variable(s) (self-esteem and body image in their study) occurred prior to gender differences in the dependent variable (depression) since gender differences in depression occurred even in the youngest age group in their study (9th grade students). Nonetheless, the Allgood-Merten study yielded some important and interesting results. More speci\u00aecally, the relationship between gender and depression was found to signi\u00aecantly diminish once the variance contributed by self-esteem and body image was accounted for.\nThe present study was designed to extend the \u00aendings of Allgood-Merten et al. (1990) by examining younger adolescents so that potential gender differences in the predictor variable(s) could be assessed prior to the emergence of gender differences in depression. In addition to examining the in\u00afuence of self-esteem on the relationship between gender and depression, the present study also was designed to assess the in\u00afuence of the following self-competence variables on the relationship between gender and early adolescent depression: social competence, academic competence, athletic competence, and perceived physical attractiveness. Finally, it was deemed important to examine gender differences in anxiety, along with depression, since virtually no research has been conducted examining predictors of gender differences in adolescent anxiety and because anxiety problems become as common, if not more common, than depression during adolescence.",

Since the sample was a community sample, depressive and anxiety symptomatology was assessed. 2 The assessment of moderate levels of depression and anxiety is important during adolescence since even moderate symptomatology has been found to be a risk factor the development of affective disorders in adulthood (Harrington et al., 1990). Moreover, moderate levels of depression have been linked to school problems, problems with peer relations, and behavioral problems during adolescence (Achenbach and Edelbrock, 1987;Petersen et al., 1991, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1992.\nIn sum, then, the following research questions were addressed. (1) Are there signi\u00aecant gender differences in reported levels of emotional adjustment (depression and anxiety) during early adolescence? (2) Are there signi\u00aecant gender differences in reported levels of self-competence during early adolescence? (3) If there are signi\u00aecant gender differences in both emotional adjustment and self-competence during early adolescence, do the gender differences in self-competence precede the gender differences in emotional adjustment? (4) Are self-competence and emotional adjustment signi\u00aecantly associated with one another during early adolescence? And (5) does self-competence signi\u00aecantly account for the emergence of gender differences in emotional adjustment during early adolescence?",

The REPEATS is a short-term cohort-comparative study which was designed to follow two cohorts of 6th grade adolescent girls and boys (1989\u00b11990 and 1990\u00b11991) through their transition to middle school. At the beginning of the study, all of the adolescents were in the 6th grade and their mean age was 11\u00c18 (S.D.=0\u00c145).\nThe REPEATS data were collected in the fall and spring of the school year for 3 consecutive years.

The measures used to assess these constructs are described in detail below.\nSelf-competence. Harter's (1983) Self-Perception Pro\u00aele (SPP) was used to measure the adolescents' self-competence. The SPP consists of subscales which index the following types of competence: social, academic, athletic, and perceived physical attractiveness. Two separate subscales assess conduct-behavior and global self-worth. All of the subscales, with the exception of conduct-behavior, were used in the present study. Each subscale includes six items which are averaged to compute the scale score. The response scale for these items is presented in a structured alternative format where 1=``low perceived competence'' and 4=``high perceived competence''.\nHarter's SPP has been used in many other investigations examining adolescents and has demonstrated good psychometric properties (e.g. Lerner et al., 1991). In the REPEATS sample, Cronbach alpha coef\u00aecients for the SPP subscales have been found to range from 0\u00c176 to 0\u00c186.",

These items are summed to create a total score, with higher scores re\u00afecting higher levels of depressive symptomatology. When completing the CES-DC, the adolescents are asked to respond to the items in relation to their feelings during the past week. Representative items from the CES-DC include``I was unhappy'' and``I felt lonely, like I didn't have any friends''. The response scale for this measure is four-point Likert-type scale which ranges from 1=``not at all'' to 4=``a lot''. The CES-DC has been found to be both a reliable and valid indicator of adolescent depressive symptomatology (Faulstich et al., 1986). In the REPEATS sample, Cronbach alpha coef\u00aecients have been found to range from 0\u00c187 to 0\u00c190.\nAnxiety. The State\u00b1Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC; Spielberger, 1973) was used to measure the adolescent's levels of both state anxiety (anxiety that\u00afuctuates over time and varies in intensity) and trait anxiety (anxiety that remains relatively stable across time). This measure includes two 20-item subscales (one for state anxiety and one for trait anxiety). Items from the State Anxiety subscale are completed in relation to how the adolescent``feels right now, at this very moment'', whereas items from the Trait Anxiety subscale are completed in regard to how the adolescent``usually feels''. Sample items from 3 t-Tests were conducted to determine whether adolescents who had data at both of these times of measurement systematically differed from those who had data at only one of the times of measurement. The dependent variables in these analyses included all of self-competence and emotional adjustment measures examined in the present study. Only one of the t-tests (6%) was signi\u00aecant. The signi\u00aecant t-test indicated that adolescents who had data at both times of measurement reported signi\u00aecantly lower levels of social competence at Time 2 in comparison to adolescents who had data at only one of the times of measurement.

In addition, the psychometric properties of the STAIC have been noted to be good (Spielberger, 1973). In the REPEATS sample, Cronbach alpha coef\u00aecients for the State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety subscales have been found to range from 0\u00c187 to 0\u00c188.",

Because signi\u00aecant gender differences were found only for depression and trait anxiety, these two variables were the dependent variables examined in these analyses (no gender differences were found for state anxiety). Both dependent variables were assessed at Time 2, when the gender differences occurred. In addition, since only self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence signi\u00aecantly differed by gender in the present study, only these selfcompetence variables were included in the ANOVA analyses as covariates. The selfcompetence variables were assessed at Time 1.\nDepression. As a preliminary step, an ANOVA was calculated predicting depression from gender. This model was signi\u00aecant [F(1, 70)=4\u00c126, p=0\u00c1043]. Three additional ANOVAs were then conducted, covarying self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence in the models, respectively. When self-worth was entered as a covariate, gender no longer signi\u00aecantly predicted depression [F(1)=2\u00c179, p=0\u00c1100]. The same results emerged when physical appearance and athletic competence were entered as covariates in the ANOVA models [F(1)=2\u00c184, p=0\u00c1097 for physical appearance model, and F(1)=0\u00c186, p=0\u00c1356 for the athletic competence model]. To summarize, gender no longer signi\u00aecantly predicted depression in all of the models when a self-competence measures was entered as a covariate. These results suggest that self-competence (speci\u00aecally self-worth, perceived physical appearance, and athletic competence) at least partially accounts for the gender differences in depression during early adolescence.\nIn addition to these analyses, more stringent tests were conducted to determine whether the amount of variance explained signi\u00aecantly increased when the covariates were included. In these analyses, the models including self-worth and physical appearance did not signi\u00aecantly differ from the original model predicting depression from gender only [F(1, 67)=71\u00c114, p=n.s.; and F(1, 67)=71\u00c107, p=n.s., respectively]. In contrast, the model including athletic competence as a covariate did signi\u00aecantly differ from the model predicting depression from gender only [F(1, 67)=4\u00c146, p50\u00c105]. These results further support the \u00aending that athletic competence partially contributes to the emergence of gender differences in depression during early adolescence.\nTrait anxiety. As a \u00aerst step, an ANOVA was conducted predicting trait anxiety from gender. This model was signi\u00aecant [F(1, 73)=7\u00c113, p=0\u00c1009]. Three additional ANOVAs were again calculated entering self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence as covariates, respectively. When self-worth was entered as a covariate, the model remained signi\u00aecant. However, the relationship between gender and trait anxiety weakened [F(1)=4\u00c111, p50\u00c1046]. Similar results emerged when the physical appearance model was examined. Gender also continued to be a signi\u00aecant predictor in this model [F(1)=4\u00c104, p=0\u00c1048], although the relationship between gender and trait anxiety was attenuated by the inclusion of physical appearance in the model. Finally, the inclusion of athletic competence in the ANOVA did not appear to have a substantial in\u00afuence on the relationship between gender and trait anxiety. In this model, gender still had a strong and signi\u00aecant in\u00afuence on trait anxiety [F(1)=6\u00c136, p50\u00c1014]. To summarize, the results from these analyses indicated that self-competence (self-worth and perceived physical appearance) somewhat weakened the relationship between gender and trait anxiety. Although the ANOVA models remained marginally signi\u00aecant, these effects must be considered in relation to the fact that the power was limited since the sample was quite small.\nAgain, more stringent analyses were conducted to examine whether the three models with the covariates signi\u00aecantly differed from the model predicting trait anxiety from gender only. In these analyses, the models including self-worth and athletic competence did not signi\u00aecantly differ from the original model predicting trait anxiety from gender only [F(1, 70)=2\u00c136, p=n.s.; and F(1, 70)=71\u00c119, p=n.s., respectively]. However, the model including physical appearance as a covariate did signi\u00aecantly differ from the model predicting trait anxiety from gender only [F(1, 70)=4\u00c119, p=50\u00c105]. These \u00aendings provide additional support that physical appearance partially accounts for the emergence of gender differences in trait anxiety during early adolescence. 5",

      "text": "The primary objective of the present study was to examine whether self-competence predicts the emergence of gender differences in depression and anxiety during early adolescence. Consistent with the literature (Allgood-Merten et al., 1990;Ohannessian et al.,1996), adolescent girls were found to have signi\u00aecantly lower levels of perceived self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence than adolescent boys during 6th and 7th grade. In addition, adolescent girls reported signi\u00aecantly higher levels of depression and trait anxiety than adolescent boys during 7th grade. These results are consistent with recent studies which have indicated that adolescent girls report higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptomatology as early as 11 or 12 years of age (Kandel and Davies, 1986;Ohannessian et al., 1996). It is important to note that in present study, signi\u00aecant differences in depression and anxiety were not found during 6th grade. Although there were signi\u00aecant differences in self-competence during sixth grade, differences in depression and anxiety had not yet emerged.\nSince gender differences in self-competence were found to precede gender differences in depression and anxiety, these results are compatible with the hypothesis that gender differences in self-competence predict the emergence of gender differences in emotional adjustment. In order to further test this hypothesis, the bivariate relations between he measures of self-competence and emotional adjustment were examined to determine whether they were signi\u00aecantly associated with one another. For both girls and boys, the pattern of results indicated that higher levels of self-competence (e.g. self-worth, perceived physical appearance, social competence, academic competence, and athletic competence) were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety. These results also are consistent with recent research which has shown that perceptions of the self and emotional adjustment are positively related during early adolescence (Papini and Roggman, 1992).\nTo summarize thus far, results from the present study indicated that (1) gender differences in self-competence, depression, and anxiety occur during early adolescence; (2) gender differences in self-competence precede gender differences in emotional adjustment; and\n(3) self-competence is inversely related to depression and anxiety for both boys and girls during early adolescence. In order to test whether gender differences in self-competence predict gender differences in depression and anxiety, the self-competence variables were entered as covariates in a series of ANOVAs predicting emotional adjustment from gender. In these analyses, the relationship between gender and depression became non-signi\u00aecant when the variance contributed by self-worth, perceived physical appearance, or athletic competence was accounted for. Similar, although not as striking, results were found for trait anxiety since the relationship between gender and trait anxiety diminished, but remained signi\u00aecant, when the self-competence variables were covaried in the ANOVA models. These results are consistent with those found by Allgood-Merten et al. (1990), who found that the relationship between gender and depression during middle adolescence (using a sample of 9th\u00b112th grade students) became non-signi\u00aecant once the variance contributed by self-esteem was accounted for.\nImportantly, \u00aendings from the present study extend those found by Allgood-Merten et al.(1990) since: (1) younger adolescents were assessed prior to the emergence of gender differences in emotional problems (speci\u00aecally, depression and anxiety); (2) many constructs relating to the adolescents' perceptions of the self were examined, along with self-esteem; and (3) gender differences in both depression and anxiety were examined. To date, virtually all of the research that has examined predictors of gender differences in adolescent emotional adjustment has focused solely on depression. However, it is apparent that much more research needs to be conducted examining potential predictors of gender differences in anxiety since anxiety symptomatology and disorders both increase signi\u00aecantly during adolescence (Ebata et al., 1990;Clark et al., 1994) and since gender differences in anxiety problems become apparent during this time, with girls becoming much more at-risk for experiencing these problems than boys (Kashani et al., 1989;Ohannessian et al., 1996).\nAlthough the results from the present study indicate that self-competence partially accounts for the emergence of gender differences in adolescent depression and anxiety, it should be noted that these results do not imply causality. For example, even though gender differences in self-competence were found to precede gender differences in emotional adjustment, it may be the case that a third variable (e.g. changes in the adolescent\u00b1parent relationship during early adolescence) predicts the emergence of gender difference in both self-competence and emotional adjustment during early adolesence. Future investigations need to address this possibility.\nIn addition, the \u00aendings are constrained by limitations of the sample and design. For example, in the present study, only European\u00b1American, lower-middle class, young adolescents who resided in a relatively rural area in the Northeast U.S. were examined. Therefore, the results can only be generalized to adolescents with similar characteristics. In order to validate the present \u00aendings, future studies need to be conducted examining adolescents with differing demographic characteristics (e.g. African\u00b1Americans and Hispanics, upperclass adolescents, urban adolescents). The present study also was limited by the relatively small sample size. Therefore, lack of power probably contributed to some of the marginally signi\u00aecant results obtained.\nIn addition to examining larger samples with diverse demographic characteristics, it is paramount that future studies assess the relations between gender and emotional adjustment over time. Importantly, the present study examined adolescents immediately prior to the emergence of gender differences in depression and anxiety and followed them throughout the year. However, it would be important for future research to assess even younger youth in order to determine when gender differences in hypothesized predictor variables(s) occur. For example, in the present study, gender differences in self-competence were found prior to gender differences in depression and anxiety. However, the present study was not able to determine when gender differences in self-competence initially occurred. For theoretical and intervention purposes, it would be important to know whether gender differences in selfcompetence occur immediately prior to gender differences in emotional problems or whether they occur even earlier in childhood.\nFinally, and most importantly, future investigations need to systematically examine additional psychosocial variables that may predict the emergence of gender differences in emotional problems. Prior research has suggested that having a negative body image, low levels of masculinity, and ruminative coping techniques may be related to gender differences in depression (Allgood-Merten et al., 1990;. These hypotheses need to be tested systematically using longitudinal data in order to determine whether gender differences in the predictor variable actually precede and predict gender differences in depression. Future studies also need to demonstrate that the hypothesized predictor variable at least partially accounts for the variance between gender and adolescent emotional problems.\nAlthough exploratory in nature, the results from the present study have important implications for possible interventions. Consistent with prior research (Kandel and Davies, 1986;Ohannessian et al., 1996), this study has demonstrated that gender differences in depression and anxiety are apparent even in early adolescence. Therefore, interventions aimed at decreasing levels of depression and anxiety during adolescence need to begin prior to the onset of adolescence. Findings from the present study also indicate that decreasing perceptions of self-competence (particularly self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence) contribute to the escalation of anxiety and depressive symptomatology among early adolescent girls. Therefore, programs that are designed to reduce adolescent depression and anxiety should aim to increase youths' perceptions of self-competence beginning no later than late childhood, especially for girls.\nAlexander von Eye.
