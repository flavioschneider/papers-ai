  "title": "The Motivational Landscape of Early Adolescence in the United States and China: A Longitudinal Investigation",
  "abstract": "This research examined motivational trajectories during early adolescence in the United States and China. Upon their entry into middle school at 7th grade and every 6 months thereafter until the end of 8th grade, 825 American and Chinese children (mean age = 12.73 years) reported on their motivational beliefs (e.g., mastery orientation) and behavior (e.g., self-regulated learning strategies). The quality of children's motivational beliefs deteriorated over the 7th and 8th grades (e.g., children became less mastery oriented) in both the United States and China. American children also valued academics less, with declines in their motivational behavior as well. Chinese children continued to value academics, sustaining their motivational behavior. In both countries, children's motivational beliefs and behavior predicted their grades over time. This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01 MH57505. We are grateful to the children who participated in this research. We thank Huichang Chen, Scott Litwack, Molly McDonald, and Haimei Wang for their help in collecting and managing the data.

      "text": "Declines in academic motivation have been widely observed among early adolescents in the United States. Such declines are evident in children's beliefs and behavior, so that as children make their way through adolescence, they become less interested and engaged in school. The motivational declines are accompanied by troubling decrements in children's achievement (see Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006). Thus, there has been much attention to understanding what underlies the motivational landscape of early adolescence. To this end, investigators have focused on children's developing psychological needs, changes in their environment, and the fit between the two as they enter adolescence (see Eccles et al., 1993). Notably, this work has been conducted almost exclusively in the United States.\nThe current research investigated the motivational landscape of early adolescence outside of the Western cultural context. We compared the motivation of children entering adolescence in the United States and China given the distinct learning ideologies in the two countries (Li, 2005;Tweed & Lehman, 2002): In China (vs. the United States), learning is a priority, often viewed as a moral endeavor, with much emphasis placed on effort. The goals of the current research were twofold. First, we identified similarities and differences in the pattern of motivational changes during early adolescence in the United States and China. Second, we examined the effects of such changes on children's achievement in the two countries. Addressing these issues is of import to understanding the generalizability of motivational theories beyond Western cultures (see McInerney & Van Etten, 2001).",

      "text": "The Case of the United States\nThe motivational declines during adolescence in the United States are reflected in children's beliefs and behavior. In terms of beliefs, there is a decrease in the value children place on academic achievement, particularly as they make the transition from elementary to middle school (e.g., Eccles et al., 1989;Fredricks & Eccles, 2002). Such diminished value is accompanied by dampened concern among children with developing competence-that is, mastery orientation (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997;Lepper, Corpus, & Iyengar, 2005). As children progress through the school system, they also harbor fewer autonomous (e.g., enjoyment) versus controlled (e.g., avoidance of punishment) reasons for doing schoolwork (e.g., Harter, 1981;Lepper et al., 2005). Children's behavior shows similar declines: Over the course of adolescence, children use fewer self-regulated learning strategies, such as planning out their studying (e.g., Kenney-Benson, Pomerantz, Ryan, & Patrick, 2006); they also report putting decreased effort into homework (e.g., Cooper, Lindsay, Nye, & Greathouse, 1998) and increased cheating (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 2004). Eccles et al. (1993) make the case that the declines in American children's motivation are due to a poor stage-environment fit during early adolescence. They argue that, among other changes, early adolescence is characterized by children's heightened desire for autonomy, consciousness of the self, and concern over social relationships. Unfortunately, despite major innovations, American middle schools are often at odds with children's psychological needs (see Juvonen, Le, Kaganoff, Augustine, & Constant, 2004). For example, children may not be provided the opportunity by teachers to make decisions to the extent they desire, thereby leaving their need for autonomy unsatisfied; middle schools may place heightened emphasis on explicit evaluation and social comparison, which is likely to put children's sense of worth at stake (see Eccles et al., 1993). Moreover, in the United States, there is a wide range of activities outside of school, such as organized sports and community volunteer organizations, competing for students' interests (Larson & Verma, 1999). All of this may lead to children's increasing disengagement from academics during early adolescence.",

      "text": "The Case of China\nThere is much evidence that as early as the beginning of elementary school, East Asian children are more motivated in academics than are their American counterparts (see Pomerantz, Ng, & Wang, 2008). Yet, a handful of extant studies reveal motivational declines among Chinese children during adolescence (e.g., Shi et al., 2001;Zhang & Zhang, 2006). This may be because a poor fit between stage and environment similar to that in the United States also exists in China. Chinese middle schools place much emphasis on explicit evaluation and social comparison, due in large part to the fact that children expect to take a highly competitive exam for admission to high school after finishing middle school. Success at this exam is key for attaining a college education later, which in turn makes a larger difference than in the United States in subsequent income (Tang, Luk, & Chiu, 2000). Moreover, in a typical Chinese classroom, teachers assume great responsibility and authority, leaving limited opportunities for students to participate in decision making (Ho, 1994;Tweed & Lehman, 2002). Chinese teachers in middle schools also provide children with less emotional support than do teachers in elementary schools (Liu, 2004). Indeed, Chinese seventh and eighth graders perceive their classroom climate less positively than do fourth and fifth graders (B. Chen & Li, 2008).\nAlthough the school environment in China may cause declines in the quality of children's motivational beliefs as they make their way through adolescence, the pragmatic importance of academic achievement in China may lead children to maintain the value they place on academics and their engagement in schoolwork. The Chinese learning ideology may also aid children in sustaining their motivation during adolescence. Several scholars have contrasted ideas about learning in East Asian countries, particularly China, with a Confucian heritage to those in Western countries, particularly the United States, with a Socratic heritage (e.g., Li, 2005;Tweed & Lehman, 2002). In Confucian teaching, learning is more than simply the pursuit of knowledge as it is often considered in the West (Li, 2005); the exertion of effort in the learning context is viewed as a moral endeavor involving the lifelong task of self-improvement. Thus, academic achievement may have not only pragmatic but also moral significance. Such a ''double dose'' of importance may lead to support at school and home for the maintenance of academic effort. Indeed, there is much evidence that Chinese (vs. American) parents put greater emphasis on children's academic achievement, setting higher standards (e.g., Crystal et al., 1994) and helping children more with their homework (e.g., C. Chen & Stevenson, 1989). There may also be fewer activities in China than in the United States that interfere with schoolwork (Larson & Verma, 1999).",

      "text": "States and China\nMuch of the interest in children's motivation has stemmed from the assumption that it contributes to children's achievement, with empirical support mainly from research in the United States (see Wigfield et al., 2006). Children's beliefs have been posited to provide them with psychological resources to sustain their engagement in school, thereby promoting their performance (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988;Reeve, Deci, & Ryan, 2001). Indeed, the more American children value academics, are oriented toward mastering schoolwork, and possess autonomous versus controlled reasons for pursuing academics, the better their school performance (e.g., Grolnick & Ryan, 1987;Kenney-Benson et al., 2006). Research conducted in the United States also indicates that children's behavior matters: The more children use self-regulated learning strategies and the more effort they put into studying, the better their school performance (e.g., Cooper et al., 1998;Kenney-Benson et al., 2006).\nUnfortunately, relatively little is known about the role of children's motivation in their achievement in China. Ryan and Deci (2000) argue that such a role is similar across cultures in that motivation provides psychological resources to meet basic human needs. They have made the case that the experience of autonomy as reflected in harboring autonomous versus controlled reasons for pursuits such as academics is universally critical for positive functioning. However, Iyengar and Lepper (1999) argue that this may not be the case in that children from the European-American culture, which is oriented toward independence, tend to have a greater need for autonomy than children from Asian cultures, which are oriented toward interdependence. A handful of extant studies generally show that children's motivational beliefs and behavior are associated with their achievement in similar ways in the United States and China (e.g., Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995;Stevenson et al., 1990). For example, two studies have found that the more autonomous (vs. controlled) Chinese children's motivation, the better they do in school (d 'Ailly, 2003;Vansteenkiste, Zhou, Lens, & Soenens, 2005).",

      "heading": "Overview of the Current Research",
      "text": "In an effort to broaden knowledge of children's motivation during early adolescence beyond the context of Western culture, the current research compared the motivation of children entering adolescence in the United States and China. We began studying children upon their entry into middle schools situated near major cities in the two countries. Children reported on their motivation four times over the seventh and eighth grades. We assessed motivational beliefs and behavior that have been identified in the United States as declining during early adolescence and affecting children's achievement. We assessed three beliefs: the value children place on their achievement in school, their orientation toward mastering schoolwork, and their relative autonomy in pursuing academics. In terms of behavior, children reported on their use of self-regulated learning strategies and their time spent on schoolwork outside of school.\nTwo goals guided the current research. The first was to identify convergences and divergences in the United States and China in changes in children's motivation during early adolescence. Based on similarities in the middle school environments in the two countries in terms of their poor fit to adolescents' developing psychological needs, as well as prior research, we expected that the quality of children's motivational beliefs as reflected in their mastery orientation and relative autonomy would decline over the seventh and eighth grades in both the United States and China. However, given the heightened importance of academic achievement and accompanying support at school and home for it in China (vs. the United States), it was anticipated that unlike American children, Chinese children would maintain the value they place on academic achievement and their behavioral engagement in schoolwork during early adolescence.\nThe second goal was to examine whether the effects of children's motivation on their achievement are similar in the United States and China. Existing studies documenting the associations between Chinese children's motivation and their achievement are limited in answering this question. For one, they permit only indirect comparisons with findings among American children; such comparisons are problematic because they do not take into account sampling or methodological variations across studies. Moreover, differences in the strength of the effects cannot be identified. Another issue is that because the research conducted with Chinese children has not been longitudinal, it is not possible to determine the direction of effects between motivation and achievement. In the current research, we examined in the United States and China whether children's motivation upon their entry into middle schools at seventh grade foreshadowed their achievement 2 years later at the end of eighth grade. Moving beyond prior work, we also examined whether changes in children's motivation over the seventh and eighth grades predicted their achievement at the end of eighth grade. Lastly, we examined the foreshadowing effects of children's achievement on their motivation.",

Participants in the United States were primarily European Americans (88%), with 9% Hispanic Americans, 2% African Americans, and 1% Asian Americans. Participants in China were all of Chinese descent. The American children were recruited from two public schools in the suburbs of Chicago. Both schools consisted of 7th and 8th grades, with students primarily from working-and middle-class families; one school was of average and the other of above-average achievement level. The Chinese children were recruited from two public schools in the suburbs of Beijing, with students primarily from working-and middle-class families. One school consisted of 7th to 9th grades and was of average achievement level; the other consisted of 7th to 12th grades and was of above-average achievement level. Reflecting the national norms of each country, class size (M = 26) was smaller in the United States than in China (M = 50). An opt-in consent procedure was used.

A trained native research assistant read the instructions and items aloud to children in their native language in the classroom; children responded on their own using various rating scales. Children's grades were obtained from school records. The overall attrition rate across the four waves of the study was 4%, as a result of children moving out of the school district or losing interest in participation. Due to such attrition as well as children's absence or disinterest at certain sessions, not all children had complete data. For each construct under examination, 88%-95% of children had the data at all four waves, 1%-8% had the data at three waves, 3%-4% had the data at two waves, and 0%-1% had the data at one wave only.",

Using a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very), children answered two questions for each of two major subjects (i.e., language arts and math): ''How important is it to you to do well in this subject?'' and ''How important is it to you to avoid doing poorly in this subject?'' Although value is often examined for individual subjects (e.g., Eccles et al., 1989), because the focus of the current research was on children's motivation in academics in general, we took the mean of the items across language arts and math, with higher numbers indicating greater value.\nMastery orientation. . Children's mastery orientation when approaching schoolwork was assessed with the measure created by Pomerantz, Wang, and Ng (2005). Using a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very), children answered two questions for both language arts and math: ''How important is it to you that you learn a lot in this subject?'' and ''How much do you like to do difficult work in this subject?'' As was the case for value, we took the mean of the items across the two subjects, with higher numbers indicating greater orientation toward mastery.\nRelative autonomy. . The Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (Ryan & Connell, 1989) was used to assess the extent to which children engage in academic activities for autonomous versus controlled reasons. This questionnaire consists of statements describing four types of reasons for engaging in various academic activities. Across the activities, there are seven statements about intrinsic reasons (e.g., ''I do my homework because it's fun''), seven about identified reasons (e.g., ''I work on my classwork because it's important to me to do so''), nine about introjected reasons (e.g., ''I work on my classwork because I'll be ashamed of myself if it doesn't get done''), and nine about external reasons (e.g., ''I do my homework because I'll get in trouble if I don't''). Children rated how true (1 = not at all, 5 = very) each statement was of them. An index of relative autonomy was created by subtracting the controlled motivation composite (the sum of the mean of the extrinsic reasons weighted by 2 and the mean of the introjected reasons weighted by 1) from the autonomous motivation composite (the sum of the mean of the intrinsic reasons weighted by 2 and the mean of the identified reasons weighted by 1), with higher numbers indicating greater endorsement of autonomous versus controlled reasons.",

In the CFA models, each construct of motivation was represented by two to five indicators. For each construct, nested CFA models were compared: The unconstrained model was compared with the constrained models (i.e., factorial and intercept invariance models). Each unconstrained model consisted of the same latent construct repeatedly assessed over the four waves yielding a total of four latent constructs, allowed to correlate with one another; errors of the same indicators over time were also allowed to correlate (McDonald & Ho, 2002) when suggested by modification indexes from the CFAs conducted on the sample with no missing data. The parameters in the unconstrained models were freely estimated without any acrosstime or between-country equality constraints. In the more parsimonious constrained models, which were each identical to their corresponding unconstrained models otherwise, the factor loadings and intercepts of the same indicators were forced to be equal across the four waves and between the two countries.\nFor the measures of motivational beliefs (i.e., value, mastery orientation, and relative autonomy) and behavior (i.e., self-regulated learning strategies and time on schoolwork), the unconstrained and constrained models fit the data well, CFIs > .95, TLIs > .93, RMSEAs < .05. Moreover, none of the constrained models fit substantially worse than the corresponding unconstrained model: The decreases in TLI and increases in RMSEA from the unconstrained models to the corresponding more parsimonious constrained models were all < .03.

      "text": "The foregoing analyses examining the contribution of changes in children's motivation to their achievement, and vice versa, represent a betweenperson approach. Such analyses focus on whether the extent to which children's motivation (achievement) deviates from the normative trajectories during early adolescence contributes to their subsequent achievement (motivation). Research taking a within-person approach has revealed that when children's motivation deviates over time from their initial motivation, it makes a difference in how their achievement changes (Shim, Ryan, & Anderson, 2008). To elucidate whether the effects we observed in the between-person analyses are also evident at the within-person level, we followed the analytic strategies employed by Shim et al. (2008; see also Singer & Willett, 2003) using HLM6 (Bryk, Raudenbush, & Congdon, 2000), which is robust to missing data.\nWe examined the contribution of changes in children's motivation to their achievement by modeling their achievement across the four waves of the study at the within-person level as a function of time (0 = fall of seventh grade, 1 = spring of seventh grade, 2 = fall of eighth grade, 3 = spring of eighth grade) and the deviation of their motivation at each wave from their initial motivation in the fall of seventh grade. We included culture (0 = United States, 1 = China) at the between-person level to identify any differences between the two countries. To ensure that changes in achievement over time were not due merely to children's initial motivation, we adjusted for children's motivation in the fall of seventh grade at the between-person level. We conducted similar analyses examining the contribution of changes in children's achievement to their motivation.\nThe within-person analyses generally revealed mutually facilitative effects between children's motivation and their achievement in the United States and China, similar to what was evident in the between-person analyses. In both countries, when the value children placed on academics and their mastery orientation toward schoolwork did not sink below the initial levels with which they began middle school, their achievement benefited (coefficients = .04 and .03, SEs = 0.02), ts(799) > 2.20, ps < .05, whereas changes in children's relative autonomy were unrelated to changes in their achievement (coefficient = .01, SE = 0.01), t(799) = 1.65, ns. Moreover, there was a significant effect of changes in self-regulated learning strategies (coefficient = .14, SE = 0.05), t(799) = 3.00, p < .01, but no effect of changes in time on schoolwork outside of school (coefficient = .00, SE = 0.00), t(799) = 0.72, ns.

The approach of directly comparing the two countries in conjunction with a multiwave longitudinal design represents a major advance in extending knowledge about children's motivational development beyond the context of Western cultures. First, despite a wealth of extant research on differences in American versus Chinese children's motivation (see Pomerantz et al., 2008), the oftenchallenging stage of early adolescence has seldom been of focus. Second, the current research directly compared fairly equivalent samples of children from the United States and China who responded to an array of statistically equivalent measures. This allowed us not only to capture broadly the motivational landscape during early adolescence in these two countries, but also to rule out a number of possible methodologic explanations. As such, the current research revealed notable similarities as well as differences in American and Chinese children's motivational trajectories during early adolescence, with such trajectories being comparably predictive of children's achievement in the two countries.",

      "text": "Consistent with the idea that in both the United States and China, as children enter adolescence, there may be a poor fit between their developmental stage and environment, the quality of both American and Chinese children's motivational beliefs deteriorated over time. Replicating prior research (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997;Lepper et al., 2005), over the seventh and eighth grades, American children became less oriented toward mastering schoolwork; their relative autonomy, however, remained stable. Like their American counterparts, Chinese children also became less concerned with mastery over the seventh and eighth grades; their relative autonomy decreased as well, although they maintained their edge over American children. Such deterioration in the quality of American and Chinese children's motivational beliefs may reflect a mismatch in both countries between children's developing psychological needs and the school setting as they make their way through adolescence. When American and Chinese children enter adolescence, they may experience heightened desire for autonomy, self-consciousness, and concern over social relationships, but be faced with heightened emphasis on explicit evaluation, and social comparison, as well as inadequate autonomy and emotional support in school (B. Chen & Li, 2008;Eccles et al., 1993;Liu, 2004).\nAlthough such mismatch in the United States and China may be similar, it occurs in contexts characterized by distinct learning ideologies that may create differences between the two countries in children's motivational trajectories. Consistent with the greater emphasis on learning in China than in the United States (see Pomerantz et al., 2008), Chinese children began the seventh grade more positively than did their American counterparts in terms of the quality of their motivational beliefs, maintaining this advantage over the seventh and eighth grades. Moreover, the value that American, but not Chinese, children placed on academics decreased over time despite the fact that children in the two countries began seventh grade placing equal value on academics. Paralleling this trend and in line with prior research (e.g., Cooper et al., 1998;Kenney-Benson et al., 2006), American children's motivational behavior in terms of self-regulated learning strategies and time on schoolwork outside of school declined over the seventh and eighth grades; in contrast, Chinese children's behavioral engagement remained stable. These findings are consistent with evidence for Asian (vs. American) children spending more time on schoolwork (e.g., Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995;Larson & Verma, 1999) but at odds with evidence for increases in time on schoolwork over the longer span (i.e., 5th-11th grades) among both American and Taiwanese children (Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995). This may be because over the longer span, children are given more homework that obscures relatively smaller changes due to lack of engagement on children's part.\nIt is possible that the differences in the learning ideologies of the United States and China may translate into distinct support structures at school and home for learning (Li, 2005). Thus, although in both countries, as children enter adolescence, they may experience a poor fit between their needs and the school environment, American children may not receive as much support for remaining engaged in school as Chinese children do. For example, much evidence suggests that Chinese parents are highly involved in children's academic lives (see Pomerantz et al., 2008); they may sustain this involvement to a greater extent than do their American counterparts as children enter adolescence. Notably, the heightened emphasis on and support for learning and achievement in China (vs. the United States) along with the one-child policy (see Fong, 2004) may motivate both Chinese girls and boys to achieve, which is evident in the lack of sex differences in China as compared to the United States where girls were generally more motivated than were boys.\nIt is also possible that the fit between children's stage and their environment may be poorer in the United States than in China. Given the independent orientation in the United States and the interdependent orientation in China, American children may have a greater desire for autonomy than do Chinese children (Iyengar & Lepper, 1999). In addition, American children may have more alternatives (e.g., organized sports and community volunteer organizations) to academics (Larson & Verma, 1999) that draw their attention away from school. The differential motivational trajectories may also be due to differences in the structures of the schools in the two countries. In the current research, the two schools in the United States housed 7th and 8th grades only, whereas in China, one school went up to 9th grade and another up to 12th grade, with children in both schools expecting a highly competitive admission examination to high school at the end of 9th grade. It is possible that because American children anticipate another school transition in the near future without much continuity from the present, their motivation decreases. In contrast, because Chinese children expect a crucial examination depending to a large extent on their continued engagement in school, they sustain their motivation.",

      "text": "Despite the differences in the trajectories of American and Chinese children's motivation during early adolescence, there were similar reciprocal transactions over time between their motivation and achievement. Consistent with prior research (see Wigfield et al., 2006), the more positive both American and Chinese children's motivation in the fall of seventh grade, with the exception of their relative autonomy in pursuing academics, the better their performance in school 2 years later in the spring of eighth grade, adjusting for their initial performance. Moreover, with the exception of chil-dren's relative autonomy and their time on schoolwork outside of school, the smaller the decrease in children's motivation over the seventh and eighth grades, the better their performance in the spring of eighth grade, suggesting that even normative declines in motivation can be detrimental to children's achievement. Notably, such a pattern was evident not only in the between-person analyses, but also in the within-person analyses, which revealed that children's performance benefited when their motivation did not sink below the initial level with which they began middle school.\nEffects of children's achievement on their motivation were also evident, with the exception of relative autonomy. It was revealed in the between-person analyses that both American and Chinese children's heightened achievement in the fall of seventh grade predicted their heightened motivation 2 years later in the spring of eighth grade. Moreover, both the between-and within-person analyses showed that positive changes in children's achievement were associated with positive changes in their motivation, regardless of country. Taken together, the similarities in the United States and China in the over-time relations between children's motivation and achievement suggest that despite cultural differences in terms of learning ideologies as well as on other dimensions (e.g., independent vs. interdependent orientation), the processes through which motivation and achievement affect each other are similar in the two countries, lending support to the generalizability to China of at least some Western theories of motivation.\nConsistent with prior cross-sectional research with Chinese students (d 'Ailly, 2003;Vansteenkiste, Zhou et al., 2005), in China, children's relative autonomy in the fall of seventh grade predicted their enhanced performance in school in the spring of eighth grade. Surprisingly, contrary to some prior concurrent research (e.g., Grolnick, Ryan, & Deci, 1991), this was not the case in the United States (for a similar finding of lack of effect, see Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994). Moreover, in both countries, no effect of change in relative autonomy over time on children's achievement was evident in either the between-or within-person analyses. One possible explanation is that dampened relative autonomy resulting from having controlled (vs. autonomous) reasons for pursuing academics may not necessarily harm achievement as it may heighten the effort children put into such things as rote learning, which pays off in terms of performance when deep learning is not required (see Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Soenens, & Matos, 2005).",

      "text": "''Learning Gap''\nTaken together, the findings regarding the trajectories of children's motivation and the effects of their motivation on their achievement suggest one reason that American children have been found to be out achieved by their Chinese counterparts (Stevenson, Chen, & Lee, 1993). Although the quality of both American and Chinese children's motivational beliefs may decrease as they make their way through early adolescence, which appears to disrupt their learning as reflected in their grades, American children's learning may be further impaired by declines in their valuing of and behavior toward academics. In contrast, Chinese children continue to value academics and maintain their behavioral engagement in schoolwork, which may counter, or at least mute, the negative effects on learning of the decline in the quality of their motivational beliefs. However, although the sustained value and behavior among Chinese children may bode well for their achievement, it may take an emotional toll on them. As the quality of Chinese children's motivational beliefs deteriorates, they may come to experience their engagement in schoolwork as not only tedious but also pressured, which may cause emotional problems (see Ho, 1994). Of course, key to examining the contribution of the differences in American and Chinese children's motivation to the differences in their learning is to assess children's achievement with tests that are directly comparable between the two countries (see Stevenson et al., 1993). The current research, however, only examined children's grades which were based on different criteria in the United States and China, leaving the ''learning gap'' between the two countries uninvestigated.",

      "heading": "Limitations and Future Directions",
      "text": "The current research has several limitations that point to important directions for future work. First, children's motivation was assessed exclusively through children's reports. Although self-reports have the merit of revealing subjective experience that is essential in understanding children's motivational beliefs, future research using multiple informants will provide a more complete picture of children's motivational development. Second, we speculated that the similarities in children's motivational trajectories in the United States and China reflect a similar poor fit in the two countries between children's developmental stage and their environment as they enter adolescence, but we did not actually assess stage-environment fit. Although some investigators have suggested that there are changes in the environment from elementary to middle school in China that may be a poor fit to children's developmental stage (e.g., Liu, 2004;Zhang & Zhang, 2006), empirical evidence on the issue is yet to emerge (e.g., B. Chen & Li, 2008). Similarly, we attributed the motivational differences to the distinct learning ideologies in the United States and China, but such ideologies were not examined. Also of note is that motivational dimensions based on notions indigenous to the Chinese culture such as social motivation (Yu, 1996) did not receive attention in the current research.\nThe generalizability of the findings is also limited. First, the current research examined an important developmental period following children for 2 years upon their entry into middle school, but for a more comprehensive view of cultural variations in children's motivational development, future research spanning longer periods is needed to cover further academic milestones in the United States and China (e.g., entrance into high school and college). A significant issue that remains is whether Chinese children never experience motivational declines to the same extent as their American counterparts do, or they do, but not until they enter middle to late adolescence. Second, in the current research, fairly homogenous urban samples in each country were recruited. Questions remain regarding within-culture variations. For example, the pragmatic and moral significance of academic achievement may be maintained or transformed to different extents in different regions in China as they undergo economic and sociocultural changes to different extents.",

However, whereas American children also value academics less over the seventh and eighth grades, with declines in their motivational behavior as well, the value Chinese children place on academics does not change and is accompanied by sustained motivational behavior. Despite such differences, the mutually facilitative effects between motivation and achievement are comparable in the United States and China: Heightened motivational beliefs and behavior upon entry into middle school in the fall of seventh grade as well as the better preservation of such motivation over time are predictive of enhanced performance over time, with evidence for feedback effects of performance on motivation. The current research advances the understanding of the role of culture in motivational development in showing both culture-specific and culture-general processes. It also underscores Juvonen et al.'s (2004) call for continued efforts to improve middle schools in the United States, highlighting the necessity of such efforts in China as well.",
