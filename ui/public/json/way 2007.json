  "title": "Students' Perceptions of School Climate During the Middle School Years: Associations with Trajectories of Psychological and Behavioral Adjustment",
  "abstract": "A cross-domain latent growth curve model was used to examine the trajectories of change in student perceptions of four critical dimensions of school climate (i.e., teacher support, peer support, student autonomy in the classroom, and clarity and consistency in school rules and regulations) among 1,451 early adolescents from the beginning of sixth through the end of eighth grade; and the effects of such trajectories on the rate of change in psychological and behavioral adjustment. Findings indicated that all of the dimensions of perceived school climate declined over the 3 years of middle school. Furthermore, declines in each of the dimensions of perceived school climate were associated with declines over time in psychological and behavioral adjustment. Moreover, the direction of effects between each dimension of perceived school climate and psychological or behavioral adjustment were often unidirectional rather than bi-directional, underscoring the role of perceived school climate in the psychological and behavioral health of early adolescents. Gender and socioeconomic class differences in these patterns are noted.",

      "text": "Middle schools play an important role in the development of adolescents. They provide a context in which students learn, implicitly and explicitly, about themselves and relationships, and about how to navigate the turbulent waters of early adolescence. There is considerable evidence that the interpersonal, organizational, and instructional ''climate'' of middle schools strongly influences students' adjustment across multiple domains (Eccles and Roeser 1999;Roeser et al. , 2000Kuperminc et al. 1997;Skinner and Wellborn 1997). Middle school climates often challenge early adolescents' adaptive capacities and account for at least some of the difficulties that arise during this developmental stage . Despite growing interest in students' perceptions of their middle schools, and evidence for the influence of such perceptions on psychological and behavioral adjustment, our understanding of this construct and its association with adjustment rests on a relatively small base of empirical findings (Bachman and O'Malley 1986;Brand et al. 2003;Hoge et al. 1990;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Way and Robinson 2003). Most studies have focused on how perceptions of school climate shape academic adjustment (Bryk and Driscoll 1988;Griffith 1995;Skinner et al. 1990), giving far less consideration to its emotional and behavioral consequences. This is surprising given that the emergence of depressive symptoms, lowered self-esteem, and behavioral difficulties often coincides with the middle-school years (Blyth et al. 1983;Seidman et al. 1994).\nMoreover, studies of school climate have predominantly focused on how students' perceptions change during the transition from elementary to middle school, as opposed to the changing patterns of students' perceptions during middle school itself. Such research has also typically treated students' perceptions of school climate as static, baseline predictors of other outcomes variables (see Brand et al. 2003;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Way and Robinson 2003). Yet subtle factors, such as shifts in student-teacher relationships or peer relationships, can easily influence adolescents' perceptions of their schools. These changes in perceptions of school climate, in turn, are likely to have various psychological and behavioral implications.\nIn this study, we used cross-domain latent growth curve models to examine trajectories of change in students' perceptions of four critical components of school climate (i.e., teacher support, peer support, student autonomy in the classroom, and clarity and consistency in school rules) among early adolescents from the beginning of sixth through the end of eighth grade, and the effects of such trajectories on the rate of change in psychological and behavioral adjustment. This investigation is a secondary analysis of a data set drawn from the Illinois Center for Prevention Research (see Felner et al. 1997).",

      "text": "Theorists and researchers have underscored the importance for middle school students' wellbeing of four aspects of school climate: (1) the nature of relationships between teachers and students; (2) the nature of relationships between students; (3) the extent to which student autonomy is allowed in the decision-making process; and (4) the extent to which the school provides clear, consistent, and fair rules and regulations (Bachman and O'Malley 1986;Connell and Wellborn 1991;Epstein and Karweit 1983;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Haynes and Emmons 1994;Skinner and Wellborn 1997). These elements of the school climate (i.e., relatedness, opportunities for autonomy, and clarity/consistency) are considered particularly important for students during the middle school years because they match with the developmental needs of early adolescents (Eccles and Midgley 1989;Eccles et al. 1993;Connell and Wellborn 1991). Researchers have noted that if there is not a ''person-environment fit'' or the school is not perceived by the students as supporting their need for relatedness, autonomy, and consistency, 1 their psychological and behavioral health will be at risk (Connell and Wellborn 1991;Eccles et al. 1993). An important component of these models linking school climate with psychological and behavioral adjustment is that it is the adolescents' perceptions or experiences of the school environment rather than a more objective account of the school that is most relevant for understanding adolescents' adjustment and wellbeing (Connell and Ryan 1987;Connell and Wellborn 1991;Eccles et al. 1993).\nThe empirical research examining the association between students' perceptions of the teacher support, peer support, student autonomy, and clarify and consistency in school rules on psychological or behavioral adjustment has suggested that they are strongly associated with one another (Brand et al. 2003;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Hoge et al. 1990;Way and Robinson 2003). For example,  found that students' perceptions of their schools' learning environment (i.e., teacher support, and support for student autonomy) during seventh grade significantly predicted change over time in emotional functioning from seventh to eighth grade, even after accounting for demographic characteristics. In other words, improvements in emotional functioning from seventh to eighth grade was significantly predicted by higher reports of teacher support and support for student autonomy during the seventh grade. Similarly, Hoge et al. (1990) found that more positive perceptions of school climate, including perceptions of teacher support, predicted increases in global self-esteem from fall to spring during the sixth and seventh grade, after accounting for IQ, sex, race, single parent family, and socioeconomic status. Others have also found significant associations between teacher and/or peer support, opportunities for autonomy, and clarity and consistency in school rules and students' emotional adjustment (see Brand et al. 2003;Bachman and O'Malley 1986;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Way and Robinson 2003).\nIn addition, linkages between teacher and/or peer support, opportunities for autonomy, and clarity and consistency in school rules and behavior problems have been reported (Brand et al. 2003;Bryk and Driscoll 1988;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Rutter et al. 1979;Sommer 1985). For example, Kasen et al. (1990) found that an increase in students' perceptions of autonomy in the classroom in middle school over one-year period predicted decreases in alcohol use, conduct problems, and oppositional behavior. In their study of 188 middle schools, Brand et al. (2003) found that students' perceptions of different dimensions of school climate, including teacher and peer support (and negative peer interaction), was significantly associated with self-esteem, depressive symptoms, delinquency, and substance use.\nTaken together, these studies shed light on the range of psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with students' perceptions of middle schools environments and underscore the importance of schools addressing the psychological needs of early adolescence (Connell and Wellborn 1991). To a certain extent, however, the statistical methods that have been most commonly employed have masked patterns of change and adjustment over time. These techniques, which have spanned from correlational and mean level analyses of groups of students (e.g., ANOVA's, MANOVA's), to more complex grouping and structural models, rest on a more static view of a period that is typically characterized by heterogeneity and flux. Snapshot views of this developmental phase do not adequately describe the different patterns over time of perceived school climate nor do they explain the changing nature of psychological and behavioral adjustment. For some students, the middle schools years may be marked by ongoing patterns of success and emotional wellbeing. Initial positive reactions to the school environment might portend ongoing opportunities for positive growth and development. For others, however, a honeymoon period might gradually give way to disappointment with their middle school's limitations. Still others might experience transitional struggles that forecast either continued negative perceptions of the school or gradual adaptation to the setting. Each of these scenarios is likely to predict different levels of emotional and behavioral adjustment. The goal in this study is to extend the research on school climate by tracking the effects of various patterns of perceptions of school climate over time.\nOur work is not only guided by developmental theories such as those by Eccles and colleagues (e.g., Eccles et al. 1993; and motivational theories such as those by Connell and colleagues (Connell and Wellborn 1991), but also by an integrated systems perspective that recognizes that perceptions of school climate are closely tied to various demographic variables such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES). Research, for example, has suggested that adolescent girls may experience school as a less supportive environment than boys, stemming from institutional gender biases, and a greater likelihood of sexual harassment from male peers (AAUW 1992;Brown and Gilligan 1992;Orenstein 1994;Sadker and Sadker 1994). These difficult experiences may translate into more negative perceptions of school. In addition, since the harassment from peers often increases during middle school as girls reach puberty, girls' perceptions of school climate may be more likely than boys to decline over time (Orenstein 1994). Furthermore, increasing levels of relational aggression among girls in middle schools has been noted by researchers (Crick and Rose 2000;Rys and Bear 1997) and may lead girls to grow increasingly dissatisfied with their peers-a key component of the interpersonal dimension of school climate.\nAlong similar lines, lower SES students may hold more negative views of their schools than their higher SES counterparts, as the former groups are more likely to attend under-funded and understaffed schools that have few resources to create positive learning environments (Alvidrez and Weinstein 1999;Conchas and Noguera 2004;Kuperminc et al. 1997;Way 1998). Researchers over the past three decades have documented the negative perceptions of school evident among many low SES students (Anyon and Wilson 1997;Fine 1991;Kozol 1992;Way 1998). Furthermore, the perceptions of school climate among lower SES middle school students may become more negative over time, in comparison with higher SES students, as their ability to recognize the limits of their school grows stronger (Conchas and Noguera 2004).",

(2) Does gender or SES explain variations in perceptions of these four dimensions of school climate over time? (3) Are changes in perceptions of these four dimensions associated with changes in psychological and behavioral adjustment? (4) What is the direction of effect between each dimension of perceived school climate and psychological and behavior adjustment? Although researchers have tested the hypothesis that students' perceptions of school climate influence their psychological and behavioral adjustment, it is also plausible that students' adjustment may influence their perceptions of their school environments. Researchers have not, however, tested both possibilities in one study.\nBased on previous research (e.g., Eccles et al. 1993), we hypothesized that students' perceptions of the teacher and student support, opportunities for autonomy, and consistency and clarity of school rules would become more negative during the middle school years. We also expected that boys and higher SES students would report more positive perceptions of the school environment and less sharp declines over time than girls and lower SES students, respectively. Finally, we hypothesized that perceptions of school climate would influence adjustment, rather than the reverse (see Fig. 1).",

The first step required each school to create a Parent Advisory Team (PAT) that was reflective of the children and families attending that school. The PAT was asked to review the surveys and consent form that would subsequently be sent home to parents for their approval. The PAT was to consider community norms and values when reviewing the topics covered in the surveys, and they were to determine if the consent form accurately represent the goals and purposes of the study. Parents serving on PAT team were also asked to serve as resources to other parents who might have questions supporting the surveys, and copies were kept in the school from office for parental review. Once the PAT signed the advisory form, schools were required to send home letters to parents and were asked to return the form if they did not want their child to participate. periods over a 2-day period.

Technical discussions (e.g., Sayer and Willett 1998;Willet and Keiley 2000) as well as longitudinal applications (e.g., Willett and Sayer 1996) of this methodology are available in the literature.\nCross-domain modeling capitalizes on the richness of two methodologies, individual growth modeling, and covariance structure analysis. The former permits the assessment of systematic differences in change within and between individuals, while the latter allows a more flexible system of testing inter-relationships among these changes. For instance, one can investigate not only whether individual differences in change in a particular domain are related to a specific set of predictors but also if change in one domain is related to change in another.\nIndividual growth models specify ''intercept'' and ''slope'' growth parameters and define within-person or level-1 models. The intercept parameter represents initial status as defined by the investigator whereas the slope parameter represents the rate of change over time. Covariance structure analyses then allows the specification and test of relationships among different individual growth models and thereby defines the between-person or level-2 models. In cross-domain modeling, level-1 models are first mapped onto a covariance structure matrix. In structural equation modeling terms, each level-1 model can be treated as an exogenous or endogenous measurement models. The repeated observations of each construct form indicators that delineate two latent growth parameters, the intercept and slope. An important step in defining both growth parameters is choosing a suitable mathematical model to represent change over time. Since we were constrained by only three waves of data, a linear trajectory in growth was selected for the current model. As the observations were taken during each academic year, this defined a time interval of t = 1, 2, 3. In order for the intercept to represent status in the sixth grade, we rescaled the time metric by subtracting one (so that t = 0, 1, 2). Apart from ensuring that the intercept represented initial status, this rescaling also implied that the slope represents linear rate of change over time. The first growth parameter, the intercept, is defined by the first latent factor and represents the initial levels or status of the measures when the adolescent is in the sixth grade. The second growth parameter, slope, is represented by the equal spaced loadings (i.e., 0, 1, and 2) of the observed variables and defines the linear rate of change of growth over time. Note that all individuals of the sample are assumed to have the same linear form of growth but different individuals may have different values for the two growth parameters. The means of these latent intercept and slope factors represent group growth factors and are the estimate of the average true intercept and slope in the population. Heterogeneity in growth is captured by the variances of the intercept and slope latent factors. Predictors of this variability can thus be easily introduced using the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework by regressing the predictors on the intercept and slope latent factors.\nThe power of the cross-domain analyses is obtained when such individual latent growth models are combined together. In SEM terminology, these combined models represent structural models that specify relationships between the individual growth models. These combined models therefore define between-person or level-2 models. These models can further be expanded by adding specific person-level characteristics that are used as predictors of initial status and growth.\nIn the case of the current study, we were interested in (a) unconditional models that would highlight the average trajectories of change over time for each dimension of school climate as well as each outcome variable, (b) the effects of student gender and socioeconomic status on both the initial levels and slopes of each dimension of perceived school climate, (c) the associations among changes in the different dimensions of school climate perceptions and the concomitant changes in self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and behavior problems, and (d) models that examined the alternative hypothesis, namely, that the direction of effects between each dimension of perceived school climate and adjustment is bi-directional rather than unidirectional. Secondary to these analyses, we also report the nature of the relation between initial levels of the school climate dimensions and initial levels of depressive symptoms, general self-esteem, and behavior problems, and the relation between initial levels of school climate dimensions and rates of change in depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and behavior problems. Cross-domain growth modeling was selected for the current study because it allows us to fully examine each of our research questions. All models were estimated using LISREL 8.50 (J\u00f6reskog and S\u00f6rbom 2001). In the LISREL model, the standardized regression coefficient is the effect size (Kline 1998). As suggested by Kline, the interpretation of the absolute magnitudes of path coefficients can follow the general recommendations by Cohen (1988). Standardized path coefficients with absolute values less than .10 indicate a ''small'' effect; values around .30 a ''medium'' effect; and values of .50 and above reflect a ''large'' effect.",

Furthermore these students were also more likely to come from two-parent families. The list-wise deletion of the student data also resulted in the elimination of one school from the sample. The eliminated school had a greater percentage of African American students than the retained schools in the sample. Ethnic variability in school composition was controlled for by controlling for minority status in the combined models.\nTo test the nature of any probable bias in the list-wise elimination process, multiple imputation procedures were conducted using NORM software (Schafer 2000). Preliminary data screening revealed percent of missing data for each variable in the analyses, which ranged from .80 to 7.87%. Four imputed data sets were created using a twostep process under the multivariate normal model. These data sets were then utilized to obtain parameter estimates for the unconditional models, the conditional models for the school climate dimensions, and the final combined and alternative models reported in the study. Results from each of the four separate runs (one for each of the imputed data sets) were then re-combined in NORM. The results indicated that the patterns of outcomes were similar for the imputed and the reduced sample models.

To this end, we tested a combined model that included the unconditional models presented above. Four different models were thus explored; one for each dimension of school climate. The associations among the growth parameters across the domains were estimated via regression coefficients between the respective initial status and slopes. Specifically, initial status and slopes of the outcome variables (i.e., behavior problems, general self-esteem, and depressive symptoms) were regressed on the initial status of each of the dimensions of school climate to examine the influence of initial levels of the specific dimension of school climate on behavior problems, self-esteem, or depressive symptoms growth trajectories. To explore how rates of changes each of the dimensions of school climate predicted rates of changes in psychological and behavioral outcomes over the course of middle school, the slope of the outcome variables were regressed on the slope of school climate dimension. Additionally in each model, the initial status and the slope of each of dimension of school climate was regressed on gender, SES, and minority status. Although we included minority status in these models given research that suggests across group variation in the association between school climate and adjustment (see Way and Robinson 2003), we do not interpret the nature of this relationship in any meaningful way given the insufficient sample size for minority students (only 9% of the sample). By including minority status, however, any possible variation attributed to this variable was controlled for in the models.

      "text": "The major goals of this study were to examine changes in students' perceptions of teacher and peer support, opportunities for student autonomy in the classroom, and clarity and consistency of school rules during the middle school years, the effects of gender and SES on those changes, and the psychological and behavioral effects of various patterns of change over time in the different dimensions of perceived school climate. Our unconditional models revealed that, across gender and SES, perceptions of all four dimensions of school climate declined over the 3 years of middle school. The decline in perceptions of school climate may be based on a growing mismatch between what students need (i.e., relatedness, opportunities for autonomy, and consistency) and what the school actually provides (Eccles et al. 1993;Connell and Wellborn 1991). It is also possible, however, that middle school students grow increasingly dissatisfied with their schools, irrespective of the actual climate of their schools. Numerous researchers have documented the biological, cognitive, and psychological changes that early adolescents endure (Eccles et al. 1993). Such difficult changes may lead early adolescents to perceive their school environments as increasingly more negative over time regardless of the actual schools they attend. Future research should examine both the objective (e.g., how much opportunity do the students have in their classes to participate in decisionmaking) and subjective aspects of school climate to assess the association between what the school actually provides for its students and how the students perceive the school.\nAlthough students reported declines in each of the four dimensions of school climate, girls reported sharper declines in peer support than boys over time (although the effect size for gender was small). This finding is consistent with our hypothesis and supports the research that suggests that peer relations during middle school are particularly difficult for girls (Crick and Rose 2000;Sadker and Sadker 1994). Our findings did not, however, consistently support our hypotheses that girls would experience their school more negatively than boys. In the sixth grade, girls reported better teacher and peer support and better clarity and consistency in school rules and student autonomy than boys. Previous research with secondary school teachers suggest that teachers often believe that girls work harder in school than boys, and report having better relationships with their female students than with their male students (Suarez-Orozco and Qin-Hilliard 2004). These biases and beliefs favoring girls may lead girls in the sixth grade to perceive their school environment as more supportive than boys. Yet these biases do not seem to protect the girls from perceiving their school to be decreasingly supportive, consistent, and fair over time.\nSimilar to our findings regarding gender differences, our findings with respect to SES differences in perceptions of school climate both supported and failed to support our hypotheses. In support of our hypotheses, we found that lower SES students compared to higher SES students reported lower peer support and poorer perceptions of clarity and consistency in school rules at the sixth grade assessment. However contrary to our hypothesis, lower SES students reported higher levels of teacher support at the sixth grade assessment and both the lower and higher SES students reported similar rates of decline in all four dimensions of school climate. Furthermore, the effect sizes for SES on perceptions of school climate were typically small. These findings suggest that while SES appears to differentiate, at least to some degree, students' perceptions of school climate in the sixth grade (but not necessarily in a consistent manner), SES does not make a difference in the trajectory of students' perceptions of school climate over time. Understanding when and how SES makes a difference in students' perceptions of their school is an important direction for future research.\nAnother primary goal of our analysis was to explore the association between rates of change in perceptions of each of the four dimensions of school climate and rates of change in psychological and behavioral adjustment. As hypothesized, the rates of change for teacher and peer support, student autonomy, and clarity and consistency in school rules were significantly associated with the rates of change for selfesteem, depressive symptoms, and problem behavior. Declines in teacher support, peer support, student autonomy, and clarity and consistency in school rules were associated with declines in psychological and behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, these models of change indicated medium to large effect sizes. These findings underscore the importance of not only examining the association between students perceptions of their schools and their adjustment, but also of examining the ways in which change in perceptions of school is associated with change in adjustment over time. Our data clearly indicate that neither of these types of perceptions or experiences are static or unchanging over time. Thus, any analysis assessing their mutual influence should account for the dynamic nature of these processes. Strikingly, our test for direction of effect indicated that the influence of teacher support, peer support, or clarity and consistency in school rules on depressive symptoms was unidirectional; the influence of peer support and student autonomy on self-esteem was unidirectional; and the influence of peer support on problem behavior was unidirectional. These findings indicate that it is often the students' perceptions of school climate, particularly their perceptions of peer support that predicts adjustment and not the students' adjustment predicting perceptions of school climate.\nTaken together, these analyses underscore the role of teacher and peer support, opportunities for student autonomy, and clarity and consistency in school rules and regulations in the psychological and behavioral health of students during the middle school years. We must take students' perceptions of school seriously as they consistently appear to be significantly associated with students' health and wellbeing. Students' perceptions of the school climate appear to be important not just during the transition from elementary to middle school (see Eccles et al. 1993), but also during middle school itself. Drops in self-esteem and increases in depressive symptoms have become almost expected markers of adolescence, presumed to be as decontextualized and inevitable as the loss of a child's first set of teeth. Yet our results suggest that students' emotional struggles, especially with depressive symptoms, are closely linked with their perceptions of the school culture. Indeed, the covariation of students' adjustment with their perceptions of different dimensions of school climate over 3 years, as well as the unidirectional influence of perceptions of school climate on adjustment, particularly depressive symptoms, provides us with unusually strong evidence for the influence of perceptions of school on student wellbeing.",

      "heading": "Limitations",
      "text": "Although the current study provides important data regarding the experience of middle school for students as well as the correlates of such experience, there were several limitations to the study. A key limitation was the small number of ethnic minority students in the sample. Although we included ethnic minority adolescents in the analysis, our small numbers did not allow us to compare across ethnic groups. Our assessment of SES was also limited. Free or reduced lunch can be an imprecise measure of SES given that not all students who qualify sign up for this program and standards for qualifying vary across school districts. However, it is a commonly used technique of assessing SES and is more reliable as a marker of SES than student self-report of family income (Conchas and Noguera 2004;Way 1998). The study sample, which had relatively high rates of both parental college education and free lunch eligibility, was not necessarily representative of the broader US population. These particular demographics may have been a function of the broad array of communities-urban, suburban, small town, and rural-that were sampled as well as an oversampling of schools with high levels of economically and socially disadvantaged students.\nFuture research should also examine additional predictors of perceived school climate aside from gender or SES. For example, the size of the student body, as well as the location (urban versus rural) may have an impact on perceptions of school climate. While a preliminary data analysis indicated that inclusion of grade size (e.g., sixth grade) did not change the pattern of results observed in the current study, 7 future research should investigate schoollevel factors that may shape adolescents' perceptions of their school environment.\nFinally, although the current data structure is very well suited for hierarchical linear modeling, cross-domain growth modeling was selected as the aim was to study the nature of the relationship of change across different domains. We acknowledge that the nested structure of the current data is not incorporated in the planned analyses and this may compromise, to some unknown degree, the resulting standard errors. We have thus been conservative in interpreting the significance of our results relying on a more stringent alpha level.",

      "text": "Our findings suggest that students' experiences of the school environment during the middle school years may be as important in shaping psychological and behavioral adjustment as the transition from elementary school to middle school. Indeed, students' perceptions appear mutable during middle school and, in fact, initially positive perceptions can grow increasingly less positive and these perceptions appear to affect adaptation. These patterns of decline in student perceptions of the school climate may even be more dramatic if one were to examine student perceptions in the last 7 years as schools have become more focused on testing in response to the ''no child left behind'' policies and harsher and more regimented due to catastrophes like Columbine and Jonesboro. Our findings further suggest that there is considerable variation among students in perceptions of the teacher and peer support, clarity and consistency in school rules, and student autonomy and that the influence of such perceptions extend beyond academic outcomes to include students' emotional and behavioral wellbeing. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for additional research on this critical period of development. Why do most students perceive their school environment more negatively over time? What accounts for the variation in these perceptions? What types of students maintain positive perceptions over time? What can be done to improve students' perceptions of middle schools? These questions seem particularly critical when the overwhelming focus in many schools in the United States at this time is on academic standards and testing rather than on creating an environment that is perceived by the students to be positive, supportive, and safe.\nTeacher Support 1. Teachers take a personal interest in students. 2. Teachers go out of their way to help students. 3. If students want to talk about something, teachers will find time to do it. 4.
