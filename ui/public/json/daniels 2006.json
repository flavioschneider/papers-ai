  "title": "A Longitudinal Investigation of Sport Participation, Peer Acceptance, and Self-esteem among Adolescent Girls and Boys",
  "abstract": "The present investigation was designed to explore the relations between sport participation, peer acceptance, and global self-esteem. Peer acceptance was considered as a possible mediator of the relationship between sport participation and global self-esteem. The sample included girls (N=4,689) and boys (N=5,811) between the ages of 12 and 21 (M=15 years) who were part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Analyses revealed that peer acceptance partially mediated the relation between sport participation and global self-esteem for girls as well as boys. Findings suggest the importance of considering how sport participation and self-evaluations in particular domains may contribute to global feelings of self-worth. The role of peers in this relationship is discussed in relation to changing social attitudes about girls' sport participation.",

Given the increased need for belongingness during adolescence, we proposed that peer acceptance would mediate the association between sport participation and self-esteem. It is important to understand factors related to sport participation because of the potentially positive effects of physical activity on school involvement, body image, feelings of physical competence, and a range of other psychosocial outcomes in girls as well as boys (Eccles & Barber, 1999;Marsh & Kleitman, 2003;President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 1997;Richman & Shaffer, 2000). We were particularly interested in exploring similarities and differences in these factors for adolescent girls as well as boys because sport is a highly gendered context (Messner, 2002), and boys participate in sport in greater numbers than girls (4.0 million and 2.9 million, respectively) (National Federation of State High School Associations, 2004).",

      "text": "Historically, sport has been strongly tied to cultural notions of masculinity and considered a male preserve (Messner, 2002;Rader, 1999). However, during the last three decades, girls' and women's participation in sport has increased dramatically in the US and many other Western countries. Before the passage of Title IX in the US in 1972, only 1 in 27 high school girls played sports; today the ratio is 1 in 2.5. In contrast, the rate of sport participation for boys has remained relatively stable at 1 in 2 over the last 30 years (Baum, 1998;Heywood & Dworkin, 2003;National Federation of State High School Associations, 2004).\nDespite the historical shift in girls' sport participation, some argue that there has not been a commensurate change in social attitudes whereby sport is deemed equally appropriate for both boys and girls (Kane & Greendorfer, 1994;Messner, 2002). Many girls in sports continue to struggle to reconcile their athleticism with traditional standards of hegemonic femininity that emphasize maintaining a thin body ideal and adhering to a rigid definition of beauty (Choi, 2000;Krane, Choi, Baird, Aimar, & Kauer, 2004;Lenskyj, 1994). Accordingly, social acceptance by peers may be especially important for girls who pursue athletics.",

      "text": "Conventional wisdom is that sport participation contributes to self-worth. However, empirical research has produced mixed findings. Some studies have shown that sport participation is associated with positive self-evaluations in global and domain-specific aspects of people's self-concepts. For example, Marsh and Jackson (1986) found that female athletes had more positive self-evaluations of their physical competence than did female non-athletes. Athletes also had a significantly higher level of global self-worth (i.e., self-esteem) than did non-athletes, but the average difference was small in magnitude. Other research suggests that the impact of sport participation on self-esteem may depend on domain-specific aspects of individuals' selfconcepts. In a retrospective study, Richman and Shaffer (2000) found that girls' high school sport participation predicted global self-worth in college but that self-perceived physical competence, positive body image, and gender-role flexibility were mediators of this relationship. The authors argued that it is important to consider mediators that might link sport participation and selfesteem. Accordingly, we considered adolescents' perceived peer acceptance as a potentially influential factor. In particular, we hypothesized that peer acceptance would mediate the association between adolescents' sport participation and their self-esteem.",

      "text": "In his interpersonal theory of development, Sullivan (1953) stressed the need for belongingness as critical for the formation a healthy self-concept during late childhood and adolescence. When individuals perceive themselves as positively regarded by significant others, they internalize the positive regard and experience high self-esteem. In contrast, when individuals view themselves as negatively regarded by important others, they internalize the perception and experience low self-esteem. In support of this theory, peer acceptance has been found to be strongly associated with feelings of global self-worth (see Harter, 1989).\nPeer groups tend to enforce societal gender roles (Leaper & Friedman, 2006); therefore, athletic girls risk being labeled masculine depending on their peers' attitudes. This evaluation may negatively impact their level of peer acceptance because they are not conforming to traditional gender roles. Conversely, research suggests that sport can be an important context for boys to gain peer acceptance (Messner, 1989). Whereas athletic ability is often the strongest correlate of popularity among boys, other factors such as physical appearance are often stronger predictors of popularity among girls (e.g., P. A. Adler, Kless, & P. Adler, 1992). However, some research suggests that sport participation may contribute positively to adolescent girls' peer acceptance (e.g., Jaffee & Ricker, 1993).",

These longitudinal data were collected at two time points (T1 and T2) between 1994 and 1996 from a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Approximately 1 year elapsed between T1 and T2 data collections. The study used a clustered sampling design that included 80 high schools and 52 junior high schools across the United States. Systematic sampling methods and implicit stratification were employed to ensure that the schools selected were representative of US schools with respect to region of country, urbanicity, size, type, and ethnicity. In total, 119,233 adolescents in grades 7 through 9 were eligible to participate in the Add Health study. There were 90,118 students who completed the in-school survey. A subset of the eligible sample (N=20,745) also participated in an in-depth in-home interview.\nIn the present investigation, 10,500 participants who took part in T1 and T2 in-home interviews and completed items that addressed the three variables of interest in the present study (sport participation, global self-esteem, and peer acceptance) were included in the analyses (girls: N=4,689; boys: N=5,811).

The alpha coefficients were 0.79 at Time 1 and 0.81 at Time 2.\nSport participation was measured by responses to the question \"During the past week, how many times did you play an active sport, such as baseball, softball, basketball, soccer, swimming, or football?\" Response options ranged from not at all (0) to 5 or more times (3). Participants who indicated no sport participation were not included in the present analyses. Therefore, only participants who reported playing an active sport at least one to two times a week were included in the study.\nPerceived peer acceptance was measured using the mean of four items: \"I feel socially accepted;\" \"I feel close to people at this school;\" \"I feel like I am part of this school;\" and \"I am happy to be at this school.\" Response options ranged from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree.

      "text": "The preliminary analyses provide some understanding of the similarities and differences in sport participation, global self-esteem, and peer acceptance. Further analyses were carried out to test if and how sport participation influences global self-esteem. A mediational model helps to explain how the relation between sport participation and global self-esteem may depend, in part, on participants' perceptions of their peer acceptance. Because data are longitudinal, we were able to look at long-term patterns of influence, and could be more confident in the model.\nTo test for mediation, regression analyses were conducted based on Kenny's recommendations (see Baron & Kenny, 1986;Kenny, 2003;Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). All of the following must be met to satisfy the conditions for mediation: (1) the initial variable (T1 sport participation) must significantly predict the outcome variable (T2 global self-esteem); (2) the initial variable (T1 sport participation) must significantly predict the mediator (T1 peer acceptance); (3) the effect of the initial variable (T1 sport participation) on the outcome variable (T2 global self-esteem) must be reduced when the mediator (T1 peer acceptance) is entered into the equation. (Full mediation is obtained when the effect of the initial variable is no longer significant after controlling for the mediator variable; partial mediation occurs when the initial variable is reduced but it remains significant.) In addition, an overall test of the mediational effect was conducted using the z-value provided in the Goodman (II) test (Goodman, 1960). To address the two hypotheses of this study, mediational analyses were conducted for the entire sample as well as separately for girls and boys.\nMediational analyses for entire sample Analyses on the entire sample were conducted in which T1 global selfesteem was controlled by entering it into the regression model in the first step. The analyses indicated that the model testing the mediational influence of T1 peer acceptance on T1 sport participation and T2 global self-esteem was significant. First, T1 sport participation was significantly related to T1 peer acceptance, \u03b2=0.11, t(10,498)=11.01, p<0.01. Regression analyses also indicated that T1 sport participation was associated with T2 global self-esteem, \u03b2=0.10, t (10,498)=9.98, p<0.01. In addition, the relation between T1 sport participation and T2 global self-esteem was weakened when T1 peer acceptance was included in the regression analysis, \u03b2= 0.03, t(10,486)=3.01, p<0.01. The overall test for mediation was significant, z=7.12, p<0.01. Thus, peer acceptance partially mediated the influence of sport participation on global self-esteem.\nMediational analyses by gender Analyses were conducted separately for girls and boys. T1 global self-esteem was controlled by entering it into the regression model in the first step. The analyses indicated that the model testing the mediational influence of T1 peer acceptance on T1 sport participation and T2 global self-esteem was significant for both boys and girls (Figs. 1 and 2).\nFor boys, T1 sport participation was significantly related to T1 peer acceptance, \u03b2=0.12, t(5,809)=8.98, p<0.01. Regression analyses also indicated that T1 sport participation was associated with T2 global self-esteem, \u03b2=0.10, t(5,809)=7.67, p<0.01. In addition, the relation between T1 sport participation and T2 global self-esteem was weakened when T1 peer acceptance was included in the regression analysis, \u03b2=0.04, t(5,803)=3.05, p<0.01. Finally, the overall test for mediation was significant, z=5.74, p<0.01. Thus, peer acceptance fully mediated the influence of sport participation on global self-esteem for boys.\nFor girls, T1 sport participation was significantly related to T1 peer acceptance, \u03b2=0.09, t(4,687)=6.40, p<0.01. Regression analyses also indicated that T1 sport participation was associated with T2 global self-esteem, \u03b2=0.04, t (4,687)=2.92, p<0.01. Next, the relation between T1 sport participation and T2 global self-esteem was weakened when T1 peer acceptance was included in the regression analysis, \u03b2=\u22120.004, t (4,679)=\u22120.33, p=0.74. Finally, the overall test for mediation was significant, z=3.24, p<0.01. Thus, peer acceptance fully mediated the influence of sport participation on global self-esteem for girls.\nIn summary, the results from the mediational tests indicate that the relation between sport participation and global self-esteem is partially dependant on peer acceptance. The model held for both girls and boys.",

      "heading": "Discussion",
      "text": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the longitudinal relationships between sport participation, perceived peer acceptance, and overall self-esteem in adolescent girls and boys. As predicted, peer acceptance did indeed mediate the relationship between sport participation and global self-esteem. Our results build on the work of Richman and Shaffer (2000) who also found domainspecific aspects of self-concept mediated the association between sport participation and self-esteem. Together, both investigations suggest the importance of exploring perceived competence in different domains when examining the impact of sport participation on girls' and boys' self-  concepts. Moreover, in highlighting the potential role of peer acceptance, our study underscores the importance of viewing sport participation in a larger social context. As our results indicated, peer acceptance mediated the association between sport participation and later self-esteem for boys and girls. The result for boys is consistent with the strong connection between sport and masculinity in US society. As Messner (1989) has noted, US society typically judges boys by their athletic ability and interest in sports. This notion is captured in remark attributed to Zane Grey, the writer of Old West adventure novels: \"All boys love baseball. If they don't they're not real boys\" (as cited in Messner, 1989, p. 103). Our results suggest that boys' participation in sports remains an important avenue to peer acceptance and later positive feelings of self-worth.\nPeer acceptance was also a significant mediator of the self-esteem that adolescent girls derived from sport participation. We believe that peer acceptance may be especially important for girls given the continuing resistance that some athletic girls may experience (Guillet, Sarrazin, & Fontayne, 2000;Smith & Leaper, 2006). As noted earlier, sport has not historically been a socially acceptable activity for girls and women in the US. Since the passage of Title IX legislation, however, youth may be more accepting of girls' sport participation than in the past (e.g., Jaffee & Ricker, 1993). Thus, physically active girls accepted by their peers are likely to experience increased feelings of global self-esteem. We anticipate that increased societal acceptance of girls' and women's athleticism will make it easier for girls to obtain positive socioemotional benefits from their sport participation. This expectation is consistent with recent research that shows that sport involvement predicts increased school attachment and lower levels of social isolation (Eccles & Barber, 1999;Stone, Barber, & Eccles, unpublished manuscript, retrieved February 15, 2006 from http://rcgd.isr.umich.edu/garp/articles.htm).\nWe believe that the mediational model identified in our analyses contributes to our understanding of how sport participation is related to global self-esteem. The large sample size and longitudinal design are notable strengths of the design. At the same time, we also want to acknowledge some limitations. First, the magnitude of the correlations between sport participation, peer acceptance, and selfesteem were small (rs<0.10). We readily acknowledge that many factors, besides athletic participation, contribute to adolescents' global self-esteem over time. However, the fact that these correlations existed across time lends some additional confidence to the validity of the observed model. Also, the small effect sizes may have been due partly to limitations with the measures available in the Add Health data set. The relevant measure of sport participation was based on adolescents' reported sport participation in the past week. Therefore, this measure did not distinguish between regular versus sporadic play. Nor did it distinguish between sport activities that were and those that were not school-affiliated. Further, the peer acceptance measure was not ideal because it was self-report, although this is a common practice in many studies. Thus, as with any study based on a data archive, we were limited to the measures that had been chosen by others. We believe that the large sample size helped to mitigate these sources of error, but it did incur the cost of reduced effect sizes.\nWe suggest that future researchers investigate whether our findings hold across a variety of sports including socalled alternative sports, such as skateboarding, which might entail resistance to the larger peer group's attitudes  (e.g., Beal, 1996). Youth in alternative sports may define peer acceptance in terms of their clique, or small group, rather than the larger peer group. An understanding of whether and how peer acceptance and overall self-esteem function for youth who pursue alternative sports may be valuable for the development of intervention efforts aimed at isolated youth. These contexts may be a place for youth who reject, or are rejected by, the mainstream to gain positive feelings about themselves with like-minded peers.",
